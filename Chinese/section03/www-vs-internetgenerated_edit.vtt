00:00.550 --> 00:07.030
Hello and welcome back to another video - we actually have a couple of great videos coming up about the

00:07.030 --> 00:10.510
history of the web and you might be asking again,

00:10.510 --> 00:16.930
"Come on, let's get to coding", but this is really important because we need to understand what problems we

00:16.930 --> 00:24.010
had in the past and how we found solutions to those problems and where we are at now. We need to understand

00:24.220 --> 00:30.160
what this whole thing of being a web developer means and what problems we're solving and what we did

00:30.160 --> 00:31.740
in the past and what we do today.

00:31.870 --> 00:38.290
So today we're going to talk about Tim Berners-Lee, the person who invented the World Wide Web in 1989

00:38.290 --> 00:43.210
and I have a picture of him right here and we're going to talk about him because he's the first web

00:43.210 --> 00:43.900
developer.

00:43.960 --> 00:49.360
And in order to explain that concept we need to make a distinction between the Internet and the worldwide

00:49.360 --> 00:49.860
web.

00:50.080 --> 00:56.200
So if I go into my Google Chrome here I have this website that I'll share in the links below.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.960
It's really really good if you kind of want to get a history lesson.

00:59.140 --> 01:06.890
But essentially the Internet started off with the Arpanet in 1969, basically a military project and was

01:06.910 --> 01:15.940
more of a test. And it connected a few universities such as Utah, UCLA and throughout the 70s the 80s.

01:15.940 --> 01:23.560
It kept growing but there was one problem that they had and that was essentially for the academics.

01:23.980 --> 01:31.460
They needed a way to share documents and up until the World Wide Web existed the Internet was there

01:31.720 --> 01:37.960
but it was really really hard for computers to communicate with each other to share academic papers

01:38.170 --> 01:39.120
between each other.

01:39.190 --> 01:42.360
Most of the time each computer had their own way of doing things.

01:42.450 --> 01:46.090
Or you can think of this as languages so it's kind of like communicating with people from different

01:46.090 --> 01:48.800
countries and a language that you don't know.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.410
Yeah sure you can make it work but it's very very difficult.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.580
So that was the problem.

01:54.670 --> 02:01.440
And Tim Berners-Lee what he did and he was working at CERN at the time he actually created the World

02:01.440 --> 02:09.400
Wide Web and what the worldwide web is it's you know the 'www' that we see whenever we type in Google.com
02:09.410 --> 02:10.600
over here.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.720
Is it common language that computers can speak.

02:13.900 --> 02:19.410
So with the worldwide web saying hey from now on everybody if we want to communicate together if we

02:19.410 --> 02:26.650
want to share images or if you want to share files let's just have this agreed upon language agreed

02:26.650 --> 02:30.730
upon protocol in order to share these documents together.

02:30.730 --> 02:32.660
So that's what it is this -

02:32.790 --> 02:40.090
those servers the HTML, CSS, Javascript, the browsers all work on top of the World Wide Web so you can

02:40.090 --> 02:46.510
think of it as the Internet as your phone and the World Wide Web is Instagram that runs on your phone.

02:46.510 --> 02:49.920
So it's essentially a decentralized application now.

02:50.350 --> 02:51.190
Very very cool.

02:51.190 --> 02:54.320
How is Tim Berners-Lee the first web developer?

02:54.400 --> 03:01.180
Well, he actually created the first browser and the first server and later on we're actually going to

03:01.180 --> 03:04.020
talk about what he did with the files over here as well.

03:04.030 --> 03:13.720
But he created the very very first server and web browser but also the first web site.

03:13.850 --> 03:15.860
And they actually still have a copy of it.

03:15.890 --> 03:21.690
This is the very first web site ever and it's from 1991.

03:21.690 --> 03:28.470
And this is what it looked like, and he created this ability for people to communicate and link to other

03:28.470 --> 03:35.640
documents, so that we have this growing knowledge base of the world. In the next lesson we're going to

03:35.640 --> 03:39.300
be talking about the history of these files,

03:39.450 --> 03:45.320
What they, mean what problem they solved, and how they came to be. I'll see you in the next one.

03:45.390 --> 03:45.690
Bye-bye.
