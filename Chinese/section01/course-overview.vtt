00:01.500 --> 00:04.620
我們來談談這門課的大綱。

00:05.720 --> 00:11.640
這門課有超過一百個高清影片，它們很有趣，可讓你持續學習下去。

00:11.830 --> 00:18.100
And each section has some sort of actionable steps that you are able to followw such as building websites

00:18.170 --> 00:26.810
and sample projects and everything we use in this course is a tool that companies use in real life.

00:26.860 --> 00:32.590
我們不會教任何只用於示範練習而非真正技術的東西。

00:32.710 --> 00:36.200
這些工具和技術都是真正業界用的技術。

00:36.220 --> 00:37.720
They're the best of the best.

00:37.810 --> 00:39.600
So let's look at the course outline.

00:41.710 --> 00:48.820
The first part will be an introduction some basic concepts to get us familiar with the web and how it

00:48.820 --> 00:49.870
works.

00:50.050 --> 00:55.250
We will start off with how the Internet works what is the history of these technologies.

00:55.330 --> 01:01.030
And I'll actually have you understand the underlying concepts of the Internet and how the technologies

01:01.060 --> 01:04.840
we have now have come to be where they are.

01:05.830 --> 01:12.440
We're going to talk about the history of the web the web browsers and then we're going to learn HTML5

01:12.600 --> 01:19.890
Finally building our first website will also get into some advanced HTML where we're going to build

01:19.890 --> 01:24.820
some complex forms and get you really really good at this technology.

01:24.840 --> 01:32.340
We will then move into CSS which allows us to style our websites and make them beautiful.

01:32.700 --> 01:39.840
Afterwards we'll get into advanced CSS and using CSS 3 features like transitions and gradients

01:40.500 --> 01:46.560
in the advanced CSS section we'll create a background generator project that is going to be a lot of

01:46.560 --> 01:47.240
fun.

01:47.520 --> 01:55.570
Once we've mastered how to work with websites using HTML and CSS we'll then start learning about Bootstrap 4

01:55.600 --> 02:02.650
templates and building your own startup landing page that accepts emails and will actually store

02:02.800 --> 02:07.160
the emails of users as people who are interested in your startup.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.570
A very useful skill that you will definitely need in your career.

02:10.570 --> 02:15.850
Or if you have a business idea that you want to pursue and show you how some freelancers are making

02:15.850 --> 02:21.310
a living working remotely using just these tools and how you can use them as well.

02:22.390 --> 02:26.570
Finally we finish off Part 1 with Career of a Developer.

02:26.860 --> 02:30.390
What does the career of a developer actually entail.

02:30.820 --> 02:36.940
What are the salaries what are the differences between a software developer, mobile developer, software

02:36.940 --> 02:39.700
engineer, full stack developer.

02:39.790 --> 02:44.260
We're going to cover all of that and we're also going to talk about the future trends and what skills

02:44.470 --> 02:46.210
do you need in the future.

02:46.210 --> 02:53.110
From Part 1 we move to our next section in here we'll start to introduce javascript and learn basic

02:53.110 --> 02:59.380
concepts that allow us to learn a real programming language and the most popular programming language

02:59.410 --> 03:01.270
which is javascript.

03:01.300 --> 03:08.710
We then move to Dom manipulation where we'll actually use Javascript to create actions and behaviors

03:09.040 --> 03:11.230
to our website so they're interactive.

03:11.320 --> 03:17.170
And then finally we're going to learn some advanced javascript concepts so that we can use javascript

03:17.320 --> 03:19.990
to control the machines around us.

03:20.630 --> 03:27.410
Now just knowing HTML, CSS, and Javascript is not good enough and you won't be able to grow in your

03:27.410 --> 03:31.900
role and command a higher salary just with those three skills.

03:31.940 --> 03:37.160
I'm going to be teaching you these things coming up because these are the things you should know

03:37.160 --> 03:41.720
so that you are miles ahead of the rest.

03:41.780 --> 03:46.640
So after the Javascript section we're going to start getting into the command line and working with

03:46.640 --> 03:47.580
the terminal.

03:47.660 --> 03:52.700
We then learn about developer environments and I'll actually show you what my developer environment

03:52.730 --> 03:59.580
on my computer looks like when I'm working. We'll be setting up our own computers with all the tools necessary

04:00.000 --> 04:01.380
of a real life developer.

04:01.590 --> 04:08.580
So you can use the same setup when you go and work for somebody or for yourself knowing that your environment

04:08.970 --> 04:10.370
is professionally set up.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.890
We will then learn about Git and Github,

04:13.900 --> 04:20.410
probably the most important tools of a developer and I'll show you how teams work with these technologies

04:20.740 --> 04:27.840
to create collaborative software. We then get into a fun section which is A Day in the Life of a Developer

04:28.730 --> 04:37.890
and I'll show you what a day to day from 9am to 5pm what it looks like and what tools you'll use I will

04:37.890 --> 04:44.010
take you through a sample day at a tech company, just so that on your first day on the job you won't

04:44.010 --> 04:44.850
be surprised.

04:45.180 --> 04:52.380
We will then jump to NPM and NPM scripts a way for developers to share their code and Javascript snippets

04:53.040 --> 04:56.110
and it's going to open up a whole world of possibilities.

04:57.700 --> 05:01.170
Finally we finish off Part 2 with React.js

05:01.230 --> 05:09.480
you'll learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook, and Instagram use to build fast, scalable

05:09.540 --> 05:11.580
applications.

05:11.580 --> 05:14.820
This is one of the highest in demand skills in the industry.

05:14.970 --> 05:19.040
Its so much fun and I'm really, really excited about that section.

05:19.790 --> 05:28.580
From Part 2 we'll move on to a nice short one which will introduce us to the worlds outside of just

05:28.580 --> 05:34.760
the Front End that is just building websites without communicating with any other web site or the outside

05:34.760 --> 05:36.400
world or servers.

05:37.230 --> 05:44.890
We're going to learn about HTTP, JSON, and AJAX something that will open up a world of possibilities.

05:44.970 --> 05:49.110
We'll learn about the Back End basics and what Back End developers do.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.830
And then finally I'll introduce you to some APIs,

05:52.170 --> 05:56.980
what APIs are and definitely some really interesting APIs that are out there.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.600
This section is really going to open up your world from just being a Front End developer that is really

06:03.600 --> 06:09.600
good at building websites to somebody that can create really dynamic applications and it will set us

06:09.600 --> 06:16.040
up for Part 4. This is where it gets really, really fun.

06:16.070 --> 06:21.650
We're going to start working on our final project called SmartBrain and we're going to start off by

06:21.650 --> 06:28.250
working on the front end that is using CSS Javascript HTML and React.

06:28.520 --> 06:33.910
We're going to build an image recognition app that's going to be really, really fun.

06:33.920 --> 06:41.330
You submit a URL and using a machine learning API we're going to detect to see if in that photo

06:41.450 --> 06:46.450
there is a face and then detect where that face is with the square box.

06:46.630 --> 06:52.460
We're going to create a sign in form, a registration form and it's going to be really, really impressive

06:52.550 --> 06:58.780
something that you're going to be able to use in your portfolio and impress future employers or clients.

07:00.180 --> 07:05.650
We then take a break from the SmartBrain project to introduce you to Node.js and Express.

07:05.970 --> 07:12.540
This is where I show you how to build a server, how to create a restful API so that when we get into

07:12.540 --> 07:18.720
the next section the SmartBrain server section, we build our own server so that we're actually able

07:18.720 --> 07:27.990
to communicate with the server over HTTP and sign into our app, sign out, have profiles and do all

07:27.990 --> 07:29.760
sorts of really interesting things.

07:30.490 --> 07:36.220
From there we again take a break and learn about databases, a really complex topic but I'm going to make

07:36.220 --> 07:41.380
it simple for you to understand how they work and in the next section we're actually going to create

07:41.380 --> 07:49.570
our own database using Postgres and connect it to our server so that at the end you'll have a fully

07:49.570 --> 07:57.460
working app that has a frontend client web site, a backend server, and a server that's working with a

07:57.460 --> 07:58.570
database.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.460
Pretty much a full fledged application.

08:01.480 --> 08:07.660
And finally we're going to deploy and launch that application so you know exactly how to put a real life

08:07.660 --> 08:14.770
app that is secure and won't get hacked, on the web, and don't worry I'm going to provide all files for

08:14.770 --> 08:20.860
you throughout the sections so that you can just add them to your portfolio or you can work along the

08:20.860 --> 08:24.510
videos as well. Depending on what your learning style is.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.360
You can follow along whichever way works best for you.

08:27.510 --> 08:33.910
And at the end of the Course I'm also going to have a quick little section of some of my favorite resources

08:33.910 --> 08:39.370
to get hired some of my own advice on finding a job of your dreams.

08:39.500 --> 08:45.370
Finally by the end of this course you're going to learn the skills that allow you to apply for jobs

08:45.490 --> 08:46.520
in the following roles.

08:46.540 --> 08:53.980
Web Developer, Software Developer, Front End Developer, Javascript Developer, or a Full Stack Developer.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.880
You're going to learn the technologies that are actually being used behind tech companies 

08:57.880 --> 09:02.320
You're going to be able to build your own websites and applications.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.600
You're going to build a complex image recognition app

09:05.740 --> 09:11.320
that you can put on your portfolio but most importantly you're going to master fundamental concepts in web

09:11.320 --> 09:16.150
development so that it sets you up for a bright, long, career.

09:16.150 --> 09:22.360
I also want to make this course interactive and I'll be making videos of student projects, and what others

09:22.360 --> 09:30.680
have built in this course like you. I'll also have Q&amp;A videos, where based on the most popular questions,

09:31.190 --> 09:39.430
or the most popular topics I'm going to create new videos as they are suggested.

09:39.630 --> 09:42.660
So, we have a lot to cover but it's going to be a lot of fun.

09:43.690 --> 09:44.620
Let's get started.
