Hellooo! Welcome back.

00:03.090 --> 00:07.320
Well we mentioned in the last lesson that we're going to be talking about traceroute, what is that.

00:07.410 --> 00:15.660
Well I just wanted to finally, you know, get the entire picture of the Internet across and I think this

00:15.660 --> 00:17.580
is the best way to do it.

00:17.820 --> 00:24.570
Now if you're on a Mac you're going to press CMD Space and look for a program that comes with your

00:24.570 --> 00:29.420
Mac called terminal and you're going to press Enter and you're going to get this.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.210
So it's an application that all Macs have.

00:32.310 --> 00:37.800
If you're on a Windows machine it's called Command Prompt and in the exercise right after this lesson

00:38.100 --> 00:41.690
I will show you instructions on how to access that as well.

00:41.880 --> 00:51.000
We're going to talk about traceroute, and if you remember we spoke about this image of all these connected

00:51.000 --> 00:57.900
things happening and going to the Internet backbone and then Google.com finally sends us the files

00:57.930 --> 01:05.170
back to our house and you can actually monitor how that's going to work on here using traceroute.

01:05.170 --> 01:13.820
So if we type in traceroute and on - just so you know on Windows machine, it's actually 'tracert'.

01:14.010 --> 01:22.820
But for now we'll just go traceroute and you can request for whatever, or whatever website you want.

01:22.820 --> 01:24.810
So let's go with Google.com.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.170
I press Enter and yep, look at that.

01:28.200 --> 01:32.660
It gave me a whole bunch of hops that it did.

01:32.700 --> 01:43.870
So you can see 1 through 9 here so did 9 hopps, so that means 9 stops to this address at 172

01:44.130 --> 01:48.080
.217.1.14

01:48.180 --> 01:50.790
So again, that looks like the IP address.

01:50.790 --> 01:54.510
So again let's always test our experiments here.

01:54.510 --> 02:01.250
If I put that in and press Enter, we should get Google.com. Let's see look at that google.com.

02:01.340 --> 02:06.440
So that's a fun little way of you to see where your requests go.

02:06.470 --> 02:13.310
And you can monitor, you can see all these IP addresses are different computers, that are trying to locate

02:13.610 --> 02:14.930
the Google servers.

02:14.990 --> 02:20.600
So go ahead and the next the next section there's a little exercise you can play around with this and

02:20.630 --> 02:23.640
just see where all your requests go all over the world.

02:23.720 --> 02:24.980
I think it's very very cool.

02:25.160 --> 02:31.670
We're going to finish up in the next section with some fundamentals and what we can do with this knowledge

02:31.670 --> 02:35.930
that we have, to actually become really good web developers.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.850
So see in the next section Bye-bye.
