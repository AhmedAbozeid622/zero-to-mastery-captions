WEBVTT

00:01.620 --> 00:04.540
Hellooooo!

00:04.740 --> 00:08.250
That was a little bit excessive but I'm very very excited to start the course.

00:08.250 --> 00:08.790
All right.

00:09.030 --> 00:13.560
So in this section we're going to be talking about browsing the web it's the first part in the How

00:13.560 --> 00:17.160
the Internet Works section, and some of you are thinking right now.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.670
Whoa, whoa, whoa Andrei,

00:18.870 --> 00:19.370
come on.

00:19.470 --> 00:20.760
I know how the Internet works.

00:20.760 --> 00:21.380
Let's get to the

00:21.380 --> 00:24.020
heavy, you know, technical stuff.

00:24.030 --> 00:29.860
But you know this is something that actually took me quite a few years to learn.

00:30.060 --> 00:36.420
And I see a lot of people just skimming the surface of this stuff without fully understanding how everything

00:36.420 --> 00:43.060
works together, and without having those foundations it's actually very, very difficult to think about performance,

00:43.080 --> 00:45.680
optimizing your sites and so on and so on.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.830
So we're going to start off very, very basic and we're going to learn something

00:48.830 --> 00:55.860
that took me many years to to learn and once I figured this out everything clicked so just hang in there

00:55.980 --> 00:59.760
trust me, I promise you you'll learn something new in this section and we're going to be talking about

00:59.880 --> 01:01.180
browsing the web.

01:01.230 --> 01:08.970
So we have over here a laptop and we have our browser let's say Google Chrome and we typically like

01:09.000 --> 01:14.500
to say, go to Google and we're going to visit Google so we type in Google.com

01:14.520 --> 01:17.290
Well what happens technically when we do that?

01:17.340 --> 01:22.300
So when we enter Google.com we press enter on our keyboard.

01:22.440 --> 01:26.510
We ask a question who's this Google.com fellow?

01:26.510 --> 01:31.570
And that question gets asked all the way down to our ISP.

01:31.580 --> 01:36.500
So ISP is Internet Service Provider and I put a dollar sign up here just so you know those are

01:36.500 --> 01:39.770
the people that you pay so you can have the Internet.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.280
So if you're in the states that's Cogiko, Verizon.

01:43.280 --> 01:49.220
If you're in Canada that'll be Bell or Rogers or you know, depending on your country you have your big big

01:49.220 --> 01:55.940
companies that make a lot of money from Internet users. So they get that request and they send that off

01:55.970 --> 02:01.620
to something called the DNS server so Domain Name Servers and we'll get into that later on.

02:01.790 --> 02:04.190
Later on in the course.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.350
So don't worry too much about it.

02:05.360 --> 02:13.610
But essentially it's a phone book - a phone book that has the list of all these URLs

02:13.700 --> 02:19.980
like Google.com and it has the addresses of them, so exactly like a phone book.

02:20.120 --> 02:25.520
There's you know, they know where Google.com is so they say, "Hey you know, I don't know Mr. Google.com

02:25.550 --> 02:28.820
personally, but I do know his address.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.000
you should go check him out."

02:30.050 --> 02:37.640
So they send off that request back through the ISP and the website or the web browser, Google Chrome

02:37.640 --> 02:44.450
in this case gets "172.217.7.23" alright, cool, but nothing is showing

02:44.450 --> 02:44.770
up yet.

02:44.780 --> 02:48.100
There's no there's no Google.com, I can't do any searches yet.

02:49.530 --> 02:53.210
OK we receive - it's what we call an IP address.

02:53.280 --> 02:59.790
So think of this as something that every single computer has one, anything that's connected to the Internet

02:59.820 --> 03:05.520
has its own address so the laptop that I'm working on right now an IP address, your laptop or computer

03:05.520 --> 03:06.670
has an IP address.

03:07.740 --> 03:15.510
So this IP address allows the Internet to work essentially, it knows our location our address.

03:15.510 --> 03:21.900
So what we do now with Google.com we know this IP address - the browser sends off another request

03:22.320 --> 03:28.110
to the Google servers and it knows where the Google servers are because, well because we have this address

03:28.200 --> 03:34.740
so we go seek it out and you can think of servers as computers essentially.

03:35.010 --> 03:39.020
My laptop could be a server your computer could be a server.

03:39.180 --> 03:47.310
Servers are essentially computers that are sometimes in, you know, in basements or in huge server farms

03:47.580 --> 03:55.060
and they have a piece of software running that just like just like at a restaurant where a server brings

03:55.060 --> 03:55.800
you food.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.620
It knows how to send you files when you request for them.

03:59.790 --> 04:05.760
So we send this off and the Google servers say oh yeah no problem,

04:05.760 --> 04:11.070
let me give you my HTML CSS and Javascript and we'll get into what those are

04:11.070 --> 04:18.030
later on in the course, but think of them as just text files. They are text files that Google is going to send

04:18.090 --> 04:21.910
to the browser so we can have Google working.

04:22.050 --> 04:27.150
So let me just minimize this and show you what it's doing.

04:27.150 --> 04:33.800
So we're copying these files and Google server's saying yeah no problem thanks for asking for Google.

04:33.810 --> 04:34.810
Here it is.

04:34.980 --> 04:38.220
And the web browser receives the HTML, CSS,

04:38.580 --> 04:39.750
and javascript.

04:39.750 --> 04:46.310
So if we go to the next section boom we have google.com and everything's working.

04:46.380 --> 04:53.220
Now that sounded like a whole bunch of stuff that happened in between and when we're on the internet

04:53.250 --> 04:59.280
everything is quite fast but yet underneath the hood all of that is happening and it's crazy to think

04:59.280 --> 05:02.400
how fast everything works.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.540
Don't take my word for it.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.550
Let's just check this process that I'm not just making stuff up for you.

05:09.820 --> 05:15.890
If what we learned was correct, technically we can skip this process right.

05:15.890 --> 05:25.280
I mean if we know the address of Google can we just, you know, just go into this directly and just instead

05:25.280 --> 05:30.710
of putting Google.com, just put this in our search bar and it automatically goes to the Google

05:30.710 --> 05:31.880
servers.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.400
Well let's try it out.

05:33.410 --> 05:35.800
Let's let's open up Google here.

05:35.790 --> 05:37.450
And ooh, what a pretty picture.

05:37.460 --> 05:37.820
All right.

05:37.940 --> 05:46.580
So we go to Google.com, nothing crazy here and that's great but, what if instead of that I put in

05:46.580 --> 05:52.520
the IP address so 172, there's no way I could remember this address, so I've done this before

05:52.730 --> 05:57.120
and I press Enter look at that, Google.com.

05:57.150 --> 06:00.930
So as you can see, I'm not lying.

06:01.120 --> 06:06.830
It's what's happening. The IP address gets sent to the Google servers - Google servers sends us a few

06:06.830 --> 06:12.860
files so that we can finally load Google.com. In the next section we're going to do something fun.

06:12.860 --> 06:20.090
We're going to break a bit of Google and - and toy around with the webite again to show you how cool

06:20.360 --> 06:21.900
all of this technology is.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.660
See you in the next one! Byebye.
