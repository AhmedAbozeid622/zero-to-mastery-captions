00:00.670 --> 00:02.230
Hey they're welcome back.

00:02.230 --> 00:06.340
All right if you thought so far everything's been really really cool.

00:06.370 --> 00:09.500
Things are gonna get a lot cooler.

00:09.550 --> 00:12.160
We're going to be talking about the Internet backbone.

00:12.160 --> 00:18.940
So this we recognize this because I've been talking about it for the last couple of lessons.

00:19.030 --> 00:24.640
But some of you may have had a question that is what do the arrows mean.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.290
I mean it's kind of like magic right.

00:26.290 --> 00:33.190
I just told you that we send off the IP address to the servers the server responds with some files but

00:34.120 --> 00:39.260
this is just magic like what do these arrows mean? So, we're going to talk about that in this lesson.

00:39.460 --> 00:46.740
And we're going to do that with this really, really fuzzy diagram that I found online from this Web site.

00:46.930 --> 00:52.480
It's not the clearest picture but it actually has some really important things so I want to use that

00:52.480 --> 00:55.650
to demonstrate to you what the Internet backbone is.

00:55.690 --> 01:04.540
So, as some of you know the way we connect in our homes, at a coffee shop, or at work is we usually have

01:04.780 --> 01:12.460
Wi-Fi or you know maybe sometimes we still have people they are using Ethernet and cables and connecting

01:12.460 --> 01:12.910
through those.

01:12.910 --> 01:19.990
But for now let's just focus on the fact that we have a home and we have Wi-Fi and this Wi-Fi essentially

01:19.990 --> 01:21.600
gives us Internet from the router.

01:21.610 --> 01:28.990
You can see this little person over here working hard with a router next to him and this router is connected

01:30.340 --> 01:32.600
all the way to something called a modem.

01:32.680 --> 01:38.130
And this is something that if you ever sign up for Internet or change providers you most likely had

01:38.130 --> 01:41.320
somebody come to your house and install something.

01:41.470 --> 01:49.030
And that's essentially this box over here and the modem is something that allows the ISP the Internet

01:49.030 --> 01:51.160
Service Provider, this big building over here,

01:51.160 --> 01:54.980
we remember, that to connect to it.

01:55.090 --> 02:01.620
So this modem has the signal towers that transmit signals of,

02:01.630 --> 02:07.900
you know Google.com and it receives these messages and then this is why I picked this image just

02:07.900 --> 02:13.810
because I think it's incredible you see this wire that is connected all the way to the ISP and then

02:13.810 --> 02:21.060
the Internet Service Provider, the ISP is connected to this magical blue cable that is the Internet backbone

02:21.340 --> 02:28.330
and something that's really important in this image is the fact that there's Wi-Fi which is over the

02:28.330 --> 02:34.560
air but at the end of the day everything is kind of connected through cables.

02:34.630 --> 02:42.180
So one of you, or some of you, or many of you, or all of you might be wondering what the hell is this Internet

02:42.420 --> 02:43.390
backbone thing.

02:43.390 --> 02:45.320
It looks, (it) sounds cool.

02:45.340 --> 02:52.270
But this - this is kind of vague, so I found a really, really cool - cool thing that we can do together so let's

02:53.450 --> 02:59.250
open up Google Chrome and I'll post this Web site in the notes after this lesson.

02:59.250 --> 03:06.290
But if you go over here you actually see the Internet backbone. So, let's say we're in Brazil and we want

03:06.330 --> 03:07.770
to search Google.com.

03:07.920 --> 03:15.510
Well from Brazil, from our home, through Wi-Fi, it connects to our router, to our modem and then all the way

03:15.510 --> 03:21.270
to our Internet Service Provider lets say (the) Internet service provider is over here and then, through

03:21.300 --> 03:28.650
cables it connects all the way to, let's say this point over here, and let's say, for now that the Google

03:28.650 --> 03:31.580
servers are located somewhere in Portugal over here.

03:31.680 --> 03:38.820
Well that signal of me looking for that IP address of Google and looking for those Google files is going

03:38.820 --> 03:42.270
to go through this submarine cable.

03:42.410 --> 03:43.760
Yeah, you heard that right.

03:43.760 --> 03:51.950
It's a physical cable that goes at the bottom of the sea floor from Brazil all the way to Portugal where

03:51.950 --> 03:53.590
the Google servers are.

03:53.930 --> 03:59.100
And then the Google server says yep I got those files here there are and sends it all the way back.

04:00.320 --> 04:04.370
Through the ISP all the way back to our house.

04:04.400 --> 04:12.010
Isn't that cool that there's physical cables that are connecting, and creating the Internet so you know

04:12.250 --> 04:19.540
there are times where somebody destroys or something happens where these cable connections are cut off

04:19.570 --> 04:22.360
and you sometimes lose internet connection that way.

04:22.450 --> 04:32.380
But yeah the the Internet backbone is literally just this let me see if I can zoom out here to this

04:32.430 --> 04:38.930
network all over the world, of connected cables so that we can transfer these files all over the world.

04:39.430 --> 04:46.000
And just to show you how insane this is somebody from the Opte Project over here - I got this off of Wikipedia,

04:46.840 --> 04:55.360
mapped out, and I believe this was in 2015, just 30 percent of the network, and you can see over here that

04:55.750 --> 04:59.730
each one of these dots is an IP address.

04:59.860 --> 05:05.930
So, a computer that is connected to another computer, that is connected to another computer, and that's

05:05.930 --> 05:06.810
the Internet.

05:06.950 --> 05:15.950
The Internet is just all these connected computers that are just transferring files between each other

05:16.340 --> 05:19.890
and as web developers and this is the coolest thing.

05:19.970 --> 05:25.220
And that's why I just think everybody should be a web developer because it's so cool.

05:25.220 --> 05:27.920
You're allowing this to happen.

05:27.920 --> 05:34.580
You're allowing this transferring of files from one computer to another, transferring knowledge from

05:34.820 --> 05:41.290
Brazil to Portugal and all over the world and you get to be part of it - you get to be part of this networking

05:41.290 --> 05:42.340
and get to evolve.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.080
So hope that gets you excited.

05:45.100 --> 05:51.890
I'm you know, I'm definitely - definitely when I found this out and, when this kind of picture,

05:51.890 --> 05:57.110
of the Internet came to me I just you know I knew that this was the career for me.

05:57.110 --> 06:00.010
So, hopefully that gets you excited in the next session.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.220
I'm going to show you something really cool.

06:01.220 --> 06:07.660
Traceroute before we finish up the lesson and we get into the next sections so hope that was cool see

06:07.680 --> 06:08.600
in the next one.
