00:00.520 --> 00:01.950
And welcome back.

00:01.990 --> 00:09.190
In the previous video we went over the basic rules that all HTML files must follow.

00:09.250 --> 00:16.370
And I kind of glossed over this '!DOCTYPE html' tag, and I did that on purpose because I want

00:16.370 --> 00:20.660
you to develop a another developer fundamental concept.

00:21.440 --> 00:27.460
And that is the fact that most of the time, as developers there's so much information out there that

00:27.560 --> 00:30.850
there's no way that you can keep all of that in your head.

00:31.160 --> 00:35.690
And as developers we must get really really good at problem solving.

00:35.690 --> 00:43.040
So for the doctype let's say if I was working and somebody gives me this file and I say OK I've got

00:43.040 --> 00:46.070
this that's good but I'm not sure what 'doctype' is.

00:46.070 --> 00:52.550
Well again we wanna get really good at Googling here, and I know it sounds silly, but trust me, as a developer

00:52.550 --> 00:59.600
you're going to be Googling a lot and going to get really really good at looking for answers and understanding

00:59.720 --> 01:00.960
meanings behind code.

01:01.160 --> 01:08.780
So, if I go into 'doctype html' and we Google that, one of the first things that we get is the W3 School

01:08.870 --> 01:17.250
and this is a resource that I highly, highly recommend. They'll actually explain what the doctype is, and

01:17.250 --> 01:20.160
even show you a demo of what it does.

01:20.190 --> 01:27.960
You can read into this and get more familiar with it, but the general rule and the concept behind 'doctype'

01:28.290 --> 01:36.650
is that 'doctype' says to the browser, 'Hey just a heads up this file is going to use HTML5.'

01:36.730 --> 01:42.070
And we'll get into what HTML5, is but right now, HTML has evolved from back in the day when Tim

01:42.070 --> 01:49.240
Berners-Lee invented it, to where it is now. And it has developed and evolved so that it has a few more

01:49.240 --> 01:50.170
tags,

01:50.200 --> 01:57.090
it has a few more features, and this is the way for us to say, 'Hey, browser we're going to be using HTML5.

01:57.090 --> 02:04.000
So please make sure that you load the website properly.' And we'll get into what those new tags are and

02:04.000 --> 02:06.330
some of the new syntaxes.

02:06.350 --> 02:12.980
But again most likely in your day to day job you're going to be writing this at the top because we're

02:13.040 --> 02:17.500
writing in HTML5, if that ever changes and something new comes along,

02:17.600 --> 02:20.350
we might change this, but 'doctype' that's what it is.

02:20.460 --> 02:25.780
But the key concept here is that I really want you to start Googling, at any time you see in my videos,

02:25.780 --> 02:29.710
something that you don't fully understand or you want to dig a little bit deeper.

02:29.780 --> 02:35.660
You really want to grow those roots of your foundation so that you really understand how the landscape

02:35.660 --> 02:36.290
works.

02:36.310 --> 02:36.690
OK.

02:36.830 --> 02:45.110
So from there I just wanted to get that concept across that as a developer, you really want to understand

02:45.200 --> 02:49.890
how things work and what they mean, and you'll come across in your day to day

02:49.940 --> 02:54.640
many things that it's very easy to just, on the surface copy and paste,

02:54.650 --> 02:59.440
or just look at an example and do it without fully understanding what it does.

02:59.510 --> 03:06.650
But the developers that get really really good salaries, really good jobs, and are considered 'senior developers'

03:06.650 --> 03:10.690
are the ones that fully understand all the meaning behind the things that they do.

03:10.700 --> 03:15.820
We're going to be taking that throughout the course and making sure that we develop those fundamentals.

03:15.860 --> 03:20.530
But any time, like I said, you have any questions or you don't understand something fully,

03:20.540 --> 03:27.140
I do encourage you to Google and get the answers because there's a ton of free resources out there for

03:27.140 --> 03:31.670
you to get fully, fully comfortable with the topic.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.180
I'll see you in the next one.
