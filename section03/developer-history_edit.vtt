WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:05.750
And welcome back to the final lesson from 'The History of the Web'.

00:06.170 --> 00:12.230
I wanted to finish things off with this diagram that we've seen before in previous lessons, with a few

00:12.230 --> 00:13.920
minor differences.

00:14.570 --> 00:19.470
And that is, I wanted to show you how web applications were built in the early 2000s.

00:20.930 --> 00:26.540
So they were built with technologies that we've come to familiarize ourselves with.

00:26.540 --> 00:33.260
We have HTML, CSS, Javascript, but we also had JQuery, and JQuery was a library that allowed

00:33.590 --> 00:43.360
Javascript to be written in a simple, clean way that allowed us not to worry too much about working in

00:43.360 --> 00:46.480
one browser, then the other.

00:46.480 --> 00:54.700
It created this environment for Javascript to flourish but it is an outdated technology and there's

00:54.700 --> 00:56.300
better ways of doing things.

00:56.350 --> 01:02.610
So it is not used very often and you'll see it less and less in job postings.

01:03.070 --> 01:11.500
And then on the back-end we have the LAMP stack that stands for Linux Apache MySQL, and PHP.

01:12.040 --> 01:22.450
And in those days, back-end developers used PHP to write files that allowed us to have logic on the servers.

01:22.810 --> 01:24.560
And then we had Apache.

01:24.580 --> 01:32.740
So if you ever use something like HostGator and you had to log in to cPanel, or any of those very

01:32.740 --> 01:36.960
common hosting platforms, most likely they're running Apache server.

01:37.060 --> 01:46.850
And what it is - it's a software that really efficiently serves up files, and PHP is a language that is

01:46.850 --> 01:49.830
still being used today and Facebook actually uses it.

01:49.850 --> 01:53.180
But that's because their website was built in the early 2000s.

01:53.210 --> 02:01.720
It is now a very unpopular, let's say, language in terms of growth and job opportunities.

02:01.850 --> 02:05.370
And then we also had MySQL, which it's still being used.

02:05.450 --> 02:12.830
But again if you're looking to get hired in 2018 and you want to look for skills that are highly employable

02:13.190 --> 02:20.620
people are looking for them and there are still very few developers that know it really well.

02:20.730 --> 02:27.550
Well that's what we're learning in this course, and this course we're going to learn HTML5, CSS3, 

02:27.580 --> 02:29.790
we're going to learn Javascript.

02:29.900 --> 02:38.150
We're going to learn React, probably the fastest growing, or the biggest library for Javascript and we're

02:38.150 --> 02:44.150
going to learn about Node servers, Node.JS, Express.JS, we're going to learn about PostgreSQL, and

02:44.150 --> 02:45.540
also MongoDB.

02:45.680 --> 02:55.460
So we're learning all these things in order for us to build clean, fast, and bug free web applications

02:55.820 --> 03:02.180
so that we can stand on shoulders of giants, so we can create wonderful applications that we're proud

03:02.180 --> 03:03.850
of. So get excited.

03:04.010 --> 03:07.360
All the theory stuff, we're done with. We're going to start coding.

03:07.370 --> 03:12.890
We're going to start off with HTML, then get into CSS, and then finally Javascript, and React. And

03:12.890 --> 03:15.390
don't worry, we'll get to the back-end as well.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.140
So I'll see in the next section. Bye-bye.
