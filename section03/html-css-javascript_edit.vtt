WEBVTT

00:01.470 --> 00:03.380
And welcome back.

00:03.540 --> 00:08.250
In the last section we talked about the worldwide web and the Internet and what the differences were

00:08.250 --> 00:13.880
and then I promised you that we'd finally talk about some HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

00:13.950 --> 00:20.690
So I've been vaguely referencing these files and just told you that they're simple text files for now

00:20.730 --> 00:23.260
but what are they specifically.

00:23.400 --> 00:30.960
Well initially if you remember we had Tim Berners-Lee, who created the very first web site and this

00:30.960 --> 00:32.170
Web site uses

00:32.200 --> 00:34.860
HTML, and HTML -

00:34.950 --> 00:42.680
that's the first file over here, is a way for us to just write text on websites and these text on web

00:42.680 --> 00:49.710
sites can also have these things called hyperlinks that can link to other parts of the website.

00:49.750 --> 00:58.360
So that's what happened in 1991. 1991, we had a way for us to share documents and this can link to another

00:58.360 --> 00:59.000
website,

00:59.020 --> 01:05.030
another file, another research paper. But, as you can see it wasn't the prettiest.

01:05.380 --> 01:11.250
So in 1995 - 1996 two technologies came into being.

01:11.260 --> 01:14.860
One was CSS and one is Javascript.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.530
Now what did they allow you to do.

01:16.720 --> 01:24.610
Well CSS solved the problem of, well this is nice and all, but wouldn't it be nice if we had some visual

01:24.610 --> 01:31.690
aspects we can toy around with this website, make it look pretty and then Javascript said, well you know

01:31.720 --> 01:38.140
ideally we'll be able to have something like this Web site where you know I can click over here I can

01:38.140 --> 01:46.630
'Shop Now', I can put in my credit card and get these fancy slippers and I can do all these interactive

01:46.630 --> 01:48.860
things with my website.

01:48.950 --> 01:57.490
So let's play around with this and try and incorporate from this basic HTML file to add some CSS, and

01:57.490 --> 01:59.250
Javascript to this page.

01:59.380 --> 02:06.600
The way we're going to do that is we're going to go into 'View', 'Developer', and 'Developer Tools'. you must 

02:06.600 --> 02:10.090
- you might remember this from our previous lessons.

02:11.960 --> 02:17.720
So once you click on that you'll get this pop up at the bottom of the screen, for some of you might be

02:17.720 --> 02:21.600
on the right side but it doesn't matter you'll get both things.

02:21.830 --> 02:26.420
And we've seen this before and if you look at the top over here it says 'HTML'.

02:26.660 --> 02:27.190
And that's it.

02:27.290 --> 02:35.180
HTML is this, it's this file that has this weird syntax that describes how this web page should look in

02:35.180 --> 02:35.570
text.

02:35.570 --> 02:37.870
You can see over here, it says 'The World Wide Web'.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.310
These are just text. On the right side,

02:40.310 --> 02:48.560
over here, you'll see something called styles. So styles will actually let you add styles to the website,

02:48.710 --> 02:51.000
as the name suggests and that's what CSS is.

02:51.020 --> 03:00.340
If we click on 'HTML' here and actually, let's click on 'body' without knowing any CSS or anything, if we define

03:00.370 --> 03:11.090
something like color, semicolon, and then let's go 'blue', it changes the text color to blue. Chrome lets you

03:11.090 --> 03:19.140
play around with websites and actually inject some CSS into this HTML. Now without knowing any CSS,

03:19.160 --> 03:24.470
we can kind of play around, type in a letter and it will have a dropdown. So let's see over here if we

03:24.470 --> 03:32.750
can do 'background-color', lets make it in our press tab and to do 'red', make the website really, really,

03:33.350 --> 03:41.370
well, frankly, pretty ugly. But thats CSS right here - we've just added some CSS to this basic, basic website.

03:41.630 --> 03:45.120
Let's turn this red color off, because it is not pretty.

03:45.530 --> 03:45.920
OK.

03:46.070 --> 03:51.910
So HTML, text, and links, CSS, pretty colors.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.700
Now how can we add some Javascript?

03:53.710 --> 03:57.390
So remember we have three files over here.

03:57.490 --> 04:00.090
Javascript came along and said these are great.

04:00.130 --> 04:07.060
You know we have these beautiful text web sites that link to other pages and we have CSS that, its, you

04:07.060 --> 04:09.250
know you can make websites really, really pretty.

04:09.250 --> 04:15.100
But would it be nice to have some interactivity to have drop-down menus to make websites like they

04:15.100 --> 04:16.370
are now, interactive.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.800
We can actually do this again with the developer tools.

04:20.800 --> 04:26.620
If you click on 'Console' over here, without knowing any bit of Javascript, for now, we're just going to

04:26.890 --> 04:35.250
show you a simple Javascript line, and we're going to type in 'alert' and let's say "hi there!!!",

04:35.260 --> 04:41.850
and I press enter and look at that.

04:42.090 --> 04:49.170
We just made the very first website ever made, interactive with Javascript.

04:49.170 --> 04:54.800
Now obviously this doesn't do anything, but hopefully this shows you where we were before.

04:55.670 --> 05:08.200
In 1991 to where we are now, websites that are interactive, full of Javascript CSS and of course HTML.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.660
See you in the next one, bye.
