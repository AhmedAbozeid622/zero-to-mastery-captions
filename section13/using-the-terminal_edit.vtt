A big part of being a developer is being able to use the terminal or the command line.

00:07.640 --> 00:13.480
Well, what is it? In this video we're going to tackle this question and teach you a couple of very useful

00:13.480 --> 00:14.520
commands.

00:14.710 --> 00:18.860
Now on a Mac you simply do command space (CMD-Space) and type in 'Terminal'.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.520
Press 'Enter' and then the terminal will open for you.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.610
It's one of your applications and it's on every computer.

00:24.610 --> 00:30.820
If you're on a Windows machine then it is the command prompt and I'll leave instructions at the end

00:30.820 --> 00:36.880
of this video of how you can access them but you might remember this from the Traceroutes video earlier on

00:37.240 --> 00:38.190
in the course.

00:38.710 --> 00:47.130
But what is it? Well, it's how humans originally communicated with computers up until the 1980s.

00:47.450 --> 00:53.830
It was the main way humans gave instructions to computers and computers gave output to the humans.

00:54.020 --> 01:00.350
We didn't have something called the GUI or the Graphical User Interface such as me opening up a new

01:00.350 --> 01:05.930
folder and changing the name of this folder or opening up Google Chrome.

01:05.930 --> 01:09.400
I don't really need to know how this is done behind the scenes.

01:09.530 --> 01:13.760
I just click on an icon and it opens it up magically for me.

01:13.760 --> 01:19.970
But command lines are really useful because you can do the exact same thing that you do visually on

01:19.970 --> 01:26.570
a Graphical User Interface like I have here on the command line but they tend to be much much faster

01:26.570 --> 01:28.670
to do as I'm going to show you in this video.

01:28.670 --> 01:34.280
And there are also common ways to access different computers around the world, like if you need to access

01:34.280 --> 01:37.650
a server in another country where your web app is hosted.

01:37.820 --> 01:41.960
Well you'd use the command line and I'll show you how to do that later on in the course.

01:43.250 --> 01:48.710
Now in your day to day job you'll be using the terminal a lot because you'll have to access servers

01:49.110 --> 01:51.850
the database your front-end application.

01:52.010 --> 01:54.800
But you can do all of that in one from the terminal.

01:54.860 --> 02:00.320
You can also download scripts that other people have written from the internet so you can use in your

02:00.320 --> 02:01.410
project.

02:01.580 --> 02:05.290
Now these are all things I'm going to show you in the later sections.

02:05.570 --> 02:10.540
The commands that I'm about to show you work on a Mac or Linux. For Windows,

02:10.550 --> 02:15.090
I'll have the Windows version command at the bottom of the video as we progress,

02:15.110 --> 02:18.220
most of them are the same but there are a few differences.

02:18.260 --> 02:20.590
So let's get started.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.040
The first command I'm going to show you is the 'ls' command.

02:24.310 --> 02:32.270
I simply type in and press enter and it lists everything that is in my current directory. 

02:32.270 --> 02:33.270
What is my current directory?

02:33.470 --> 02:42.610
Well, I do 'pwd' for Present Working Directory and I see that I'm in the '/Users/'          , that's my user name,

02:42.620 --> 02:47.260
so I'm in my username folder and these are all the things available to me.

02:47.720 --> 02:53.790
If I do 'cd' then I can go into this. If I wanted to go to, let's say, desktop,

02:53.810 --> 02:57.030
I do 'cd Desktop'.

02:57.350 --> 03:03.800
And now if I do 'ls', I see that I have 'untitled folder', because that's the only thing on my desktop right

03:03.800 --> 03:05.490
now.

03:05.630 --> 03:08.440
I can also do 'cd ..'

03:08.840 --> 03:15.500
and this brings me back to one directory up.

03:15.570 --> 03:26.110
I can also do 'clear' to clear up my terminal and have a nice fresh slate. There's a short command 'cd /'

03:26.240 --> 03:28.780
and this takes me to the root directory.

03:28.850 --> 03:33.650
If I do 'ls', I see that I have 'Applications, Library, System, Users..'

03:33.680 --> 03:40.220
That's the root directory of my Mac, essentially my Macintosh HD.

03:40.240 --> 03:49.800
I can also do 'cd ~' and this takes me to the user directory.

03:50.340 --> 03:51.830
Let's clear this again.

03:52.210 --> 03:54.390
And if we check where we are.

03:54.430 --> 04:00.270
All right, let's change this 'untitled folder' to something like 'test', okay?

04:00.360 --> 04:05.490
Let's say I'm in the user directory right now, I want to access 'Desktop' and then the 'test' folder.

04:05.550 --> 04:16.140
I would simply do 'cd Desktop/' and then 'test'. And now I'm in the 'test' folder, but there's nothing

04:16.140 --> 04:16.820
in there.

04:17.190 --> 04:26.330
So one thing we can do is I can say 'open .' and it opens a folder that we're currently in. Okay, we're

04:26.330 --> 04:27.480
in the 'test' folder.

04:27.620 --> 04:36.910
Now if I just put this to the side over here so you can see, I can say 'mkdir(make directory)', which is make a

04:36.910 --> 04:44.950
folder 'name'. So 'name' here will be whatever I want the folder to be titled. Let's just say this folder

04:44.950 --> 04:45.760
would be called 'webapp'.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.130
Did you see that?

04:50.280 --> 04:56.440
Now 'webapp' shows up in my folder. Let's change the view here so you can see it better.

04:56.440 --> 04:57.490
There you go.

04:57.550 --> 05:05.860
If I do 'ls' now, I see that we have the 'webapp' folder and as we know, we can go into it. Let's double

05:05.860 --> 05:07.030
click here to see what we have.

05:07.030 --> 05:10.580
We have absolutely nothing.

05:10.790 --> 05:16.040
Well, We can create a file in here by saying 'touch' and the name of the file.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.890
So let's just do 'index.html'.

05:19.910 --> 05:20.480
There you go,

05:20.750 --> 05:22.470
'index.html'

05:22.520 --> 05:30.320
Now what if we wanted to open this 'index.html' again, we just do 'open' and the '.(dot)' means we open

05:30.440 --> 05:32.980
the folder we're currently in which is here.

05:33.140 --> 05:39.710
But if I do 'open index.html', it opens the file for us.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.540
How cool is that?

05:40.740 --> 05:43.890
But 'index.html' is pretty empty right now.

05:44.750 --> 05:51.300
Wouldn't it be nice if we could open Sublime Text from here and add something? Again, you can do that with 'open'.

05:51.970 --> 06:01.210
You put in 'a', so '-a' for application and the name of the application, so 'Sublime Text'. Close the double

06:01.210 --> 06:04.740
quotes, press enter, and look at that.

06:04.870 --> 06:09.380
I have Sublime Text. But if we wanted to do,

06:09.460 --> 06:19.780
'-a(application) Sublime Text' and open the 'index.html' file. We just do this.

06:19.950 --> 06:26.300
And now I can say 'html', and it will just say 'Helloooo world!'

06:27.620 --> 06:28.580
Save that.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.840
And if I do 'open index.html',

06:33.340 --> 06:36.700
We have our 'index.html' file loaded.

06:36.740 --> 06:43.380
Wasn't that a lot faster than right clicking, creating a folder, then dragging everything to Sublime Text.

06:43.420 --> 06:47.030
And as you can see, you can do things really really faster.

06:47.130 --> 06:48.230
OK, let's change something.

06:48.340 --> 06:55.360
Let's - I'm going to close Google Chrome and Sublime, and in the 'webapp', let's say I wanted to change the name

06:55.360 --> 06:58.530
of 'index.html' to 'about.html'.

06:58.670 --> 07:02.640
Well, I'll do the 'mv' command, which stands for 'move',

07:02.770 --> 07:08.350
but it just moves 'the index.html' file to 'about.html'.

07:08.710 --> 07:09.790
So it's a little trick -

07:09.790 --> 07:17.380
You're essentially just moving one file to another but, by changing the name, you create a new file and

07:17.380 --> 07:20.170
you replace it with the old one.

07:20.200 --> 07:24.340
So now I have 'about.html'.

07:24.540 --> 07:25.620
Very cool.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.300
Now these commands typing them can get pretty tiring.

07:28.300 --> 07:35.590
I can press the up arrow and it goes through my entire history, which is very cool. I can also press the tab

07:35.590 --> 07:43.410
key and it will bring up my most recent commands or completes what I'm about to write so you can do it

07:43.920 --> 07:44.990
really really fast.

07:45.060 --> 07:48.470
And when your commands get longer and longer it's a very useful thing to do.

07:49.590 --> 07:50.010
OK.

07:50.190 --> 07:53.460
I don't really need the 'about.html' file anymore.

07:53.490 --> 07:54.810
Let's remove it.

07:54.810 --> 08:04.340
We do 'rm', for 'remove', and the name of the file 'about.html'.

08:04.540 --> 08:05.800
It's been removed.

08:05.800 --> 08:06.610
Perfect.

08:06.640 --> 08:11.890
Now, what about the 'webapp' file, we can remove that as well.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.660
But if I just do 'rm webapp',

08:18.030 --> 08:19.260
well, it's not going to work.

08:19.260 --> 08:26.300
First of all if I do 'ls' or 'pwd(present working directory)', I'm in the 'webapp' folder.

08:26.370 --> 08:29.800
So I need to move back to the 'test' folder.

08:29.820 --> 08:31.300
Let's clear here.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.040
Do 'cd'.

08:34.050 --> 08:44.070
Now, my 'pwd(present working directory)' is - I'm in the 'test' - so I can remove 'webapp' by doing 'rm webapp'. 

08:44.250 --> 08:47.930
But 'rm' only works for files. To remove a directory or folder,

08:48.120 --> 08:52.850
You need to do 'rm' and then use the '-r' option

08:53.940 --> 08:57.160
and then the folder name, in our case's the 'webapp'.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.270
There you go, it's gone.

08:59.470 --> 09:03.220
And with that, you know what, we can remove the 'test' folder as well.

09:03.220 --> 09:10.720
We can go back to our 'Desktop' and then do 'rm -r test'.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.340
There you go, it's gone.

09:13.690 --> 09:15.570
And one last trick on a Mac.

09:15.580 --> 09:16.240
You can do this.

09:21.530 --> 09:24.280
Right?

09:24.380 --> 09:26.720
Very very cool.

09:26.850 --> 09:32.520
As you can see, you can have a lot of power with the terminal. And I want you to get used to writing commands

09:32.520 --> 09:36.730
on here. And from now on, try creating files and folders this way.

09:36.840 --> 09:42.330
Eventually you'll get more and more comfortable with it and things will be much faster than

09:42.540 --> 09:46.770
just using the GUI. In the developer environment section,

09:46.770 --> 09:53.480
I'll show you how you can change this boring black and white terminal to something like this.

09:57.770 --> 09:58.760
That's it for now.

10:02.130 --> 10:03.850
See you in the next video.

10:04.350 --> 10:04.910
Bye-bye
