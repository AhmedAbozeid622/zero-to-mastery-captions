00:00.360 --> 00:01.390
Welcome back.

00:01.680 --> 00:05.570
We're about to take the biggest step in our developer careers now.

00:06.150 --> 00:08.200
This is by far my favorite thing to teach.

00:08.370 --> 00:10.100
And I cannot wait to get started.

00:10.200 --> 00:17.850
But before I do I want you to know one thing: When I first started learning JavaScript it was the hardest

00:17.850 --> 00:18.850
thing to get.

00:19.290 --> 00:25.650
I remember feeling confused and frustrated along the way and to be honest if this is your first time

00:25.650 --> 00:29.460
learning a programming language you'll have those moments.

00:29.490 --> 00:35.850
I'm here to tell you to stick through it. Just like learning any language; with enough time in practice,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.720
you can become fluent.

00:38.730 --> 00:44.610
Now unlike human language though, you don't have to remember as many words, and sentence structure. So you

00:44.610 --> 00:47.030
will get there I promise you this.

00:47.070 --> 00:53.420
Now don't just watch the videos in this section and fly through the content. Really work on the exercises

00:53.520 --> 00:58.840
I give you at the end of the videos and make sure you understand each topic.

00:58.970 --> 01:03.460
Finally, this section will teach you the basics of JavaScript.

01:03.470 --> 01:10.970
It all seems very strange and detached sometimes from HTML on CSS - as a matter of fact we won't be touching

01:10.970 --> 01:13.220
HTML and CSS very much.

01:13.220 --> 01:20.000
However, in the next section I will show you how our new found knowledge of JavaScript can now be connected

01:20.390 --> 01:23.850
to our HTML and CSS websites.

01:23.860 --> 01:26.180
This is when the real magic happens.

01:26.290 --> 01:29.110
So stay strong, stay determined.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.870
You'll get there in due time.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.240
Let's get started, shall we? See you in the next one. Bye-bye
