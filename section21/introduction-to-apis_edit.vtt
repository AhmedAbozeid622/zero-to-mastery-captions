00:00.930 --> 00:09.480
API or Application Programming Interface is a messenger that takes the request and tells the system

00:09.780 --> 00:10.540
what to do.

00:11.380 --> 00:11.940
Huh?

00:12.310 --> 00:14.190
That doesn't mean much, does it?

00:14.360 --> 00:20.160
In this video, I'm going to explain to you exactly what an API is without all this confusing wording.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.910
I have over here "skyscanner".

00:23.030 --> 00:26.500
If you've never used it, it's an Aggregator Web site.

00:26.590 --> 00:35.230
I look for a flight from LA to New York and it searches all the Web sites all the airlines for the

00:35.230 --> 00:36.410
best deals for me.

00:37.660 --> 00:40.440
Now how is it able to do that?

00:40.650 --> 00:48.290
It found all these flights from different Web sites. But Skyscanner doesn't really have the information.

00:48.310 --> 00:54.920
I mean this information is somewhere in the database of each individual airline.

00:56.950 --> 01:05.320
But as an airline you're interested in having this data on Skyscanner because people like myself that

01:05.470 --> 01:10.330
want to book a flight might not know to go to AmericanAirlines.com

01:10.690 --> 01:14.320
So by having their information listed on a website like this.

01:14.590 --> 01:19.200
Well now they can increase their revenue.

01:19.240 --> 01:24.860
So how is Skyscanner able to do this without having this information themselves?

01:25.980 --> 01:26.780
Well,

01:27.060 --> 01:28.620
That's where API is coming.

01:28.680 --> 01:35.730
If you remember, APIs is what allows strangers to speak to each other, so that we aren't in a closed

01:35.790 --> 01:36.510
system.

01:36.720 --> 01:46.630
We can share data and work with each other and APIs' what allows machines, computers to communicate.

01:46.830 --> 01:53.100
This might sound familiar it's kind of like how we had web browsers speaking with

01:53.250 --> 01:53.780
servers, right?

01:54.060 --> 01:57.960
Well yeah because API is a broad topic.

01:58.110 --> 02:02.050
It applies to the way machines communicate.

02:02.070 --> 02:10.140
If I open up my console here, well, I always mentioned that there is a window object. and the window object

02:10.140 --> 02:16.940
has fetch. and fetch is an API.

02:17.140 --> 02:27.970
It is given by the browser to use, so that I can communicate with this machine that the console can communicate

02:28.030 --> 02:30.450
with the browser. In the same way,

02:32.060 --> 02:42.010
although Skyscanner doesn't have access to the databases of American Airlines and Alaska Airlines all

02:42.020 --> 02:49.430
the other airlines use APIs or give access to this information through APIs.

02:49.700 --> 02:57.580
So that Web sites like Skyscanner can have the information as well and listed on their websites.

02:57.750 --> 03:04.830
The best way to think about it is kind of like a waiter. You're sitting at a table about to order and

03:04.920 --> 03:09.340
the waiter is the messenger that tells the kitchen what to do.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.930
The kitchen is providing the waiter the restaurant, right?
 
03:12.930 --> 03:18.260
The restaurant is saying "Hey, waiter, these are the menu items.

03:18.390 --> 03:24.480
Please go ask the customer what he or she wants and let us know so that we can prepare."

03:24.690 --> 03:28.510
And this might sound similar to this, right?

03:28.530 --> 03:38.420
We're asking another machine for something using -let's say a waiter- and this machine gives us a response.

03:38.430 --> 03:47.820
If we talk to it in a certain way that it expects. And yeah, a server has APIs ways they can communicate with it.

03:48.510 --> 03:54.410
such as doing "users/about". In the same way,

03:54.490 --> 04:02.770
we also have our code previously from when we built Robofriends. React which is a library built by

04:02.770 --> 04:09.680
Facebook exposes an API a way to communicate with the React package

04:09.920 --> 04:20.750
by doing react Component and using JSX. They tell us how to communicate with it and we're able to communicate
 
04:20.750 --> 04:21.200
with it.

04:21.350 --> 04:23.950
Hmm- let's, let's work on this a little bit more.

04:24.080 --> 04:29.050
What about- what about this?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.250
Is this an API?

04:30.470 --> 04:33.040
It's a back of a TV.

04:33.410 --> 04:41.660
Yeah, it's an API. A TV works in its own way but it gives you access to a couple of things such as the HDMI cable,

04:41.660 --> 04:45.420
so you can plug into it and communicate with it.

04:46.500 --> 04:54.030
Such as displaying your laptop into the TV. And we've been using APIs in the Robofriends demonstration as well.

04:54.030 --> 05:04.760
We already talked about React, but you remember the JSON placeholder? the users that we got?

05:04.810 --> 05:11.770
Well, if I go to their website, we see that it's a fake Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping.

05:11.780 --> 05:14.310
It's an API, so it must give us

05:14.450 --> 05:19.380
It must be giving us information about something that it has. If we go down,

05:19.380 --> 05:28.290
we see that it has resources and the API tells us we can access them using these methods.

05:28.310 --> 05:37.500
So by just writing "comments" here, I should be able to get 500 comments, and there you go.

05:38.440 --> 05:41.330
I get a response in JSON,

05:45.570 --> 05:48.590
And even with RoboHash,

05:48.660 --> 05:58.350
Remember how we were able to get images of robots from this robohash.org? That's an API. 

05:58.350 --> 06:01.520
We can say robahash whatever.

06:01.710 --> 06:09.990
And because they've said that the way to access this API is to just type in random numbers after robohash.org

06:09.990 --> 06:20.290
we're able to access it. And people build these APIs usually for business reasons such

06:20.290 --> 06:22.090
as airline companies, right?

06:22.450 --> 06:32.080
And they have the incentive to comply to industry standards, such as having JSON responses.

06:32.450 --> 06:40.190
And that way it makes it easier for a developer like myself to grab bits and pieces from different places.

06:40.490 --> 06:43.910
For example here, I have the github API.

06:43.910 --> 06:47.120
You can read up on it but I can access information from githup.

06:47.390 --> 06:55.490
So I'm accessing the github repo of Facebook, and it tells me how many followers it has, what bio

06:55.490 --> 06:56.170
it has.

06:56.330 --> 07:02.870
If I go to apple, I can get the apple username as well.

07:02.870 --> 07:08.000
And you can see that it's in JSON format because that is the standard.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.380
If we want to build something with github, well, we can just send a request to this get this data and

07:16.420 --> 07:18.930
create our Web site based on this data.

07:20.790 --> 07:27.620
But it's not only JSON. If you remember there's xml as Well. This is a sample API that shows us

07:27.710 --> 07:35.150
a breakfast menu and here we can request this data through HTTP and we get breakfast menu.

07:35.450 --> 07:41.510
So as you can see APIs are not just web sites. 

07:41.630 --> 07:42.530
A TV's inputs and outputs,

07:42.530 --> 07:48.830
That's an API. A NPM package can be an API.

07:49.010 --> 07:56.300
Like I've said before it's a way that people communicate or machines communicate and share information.

07:56.420 --> 08:00.970
Without it we really wouldn't have what we have now with the Worldwide Web.

08:01.160 --> 08:05.220
But how is this useful to us?

08:05.230 --> 08:09.950
Well, first off we can build something like this quite easily.

08:10.090 --> 08:20.570
We can actually search API jetBlue, API American Airlines. And they'll have information of how we can

08:20.570 --> 08:23.330
access this data so we can build our own thing.

08:23.330 --> 08:28.700
This web site all it's doing is making in HTTP request to something like here.

08:30.520 --> 08:37.210
And then grabbing this data and just adding some CSS to it to make it look nice. And there are ton of

08:37.210 --> 08:39.320
APIs online you can search them,

08:39.420 --> 08:40.930
you can read up on them.

08:40.960 --> 08:46.930
Big companies like Facebook have APIs, Google has APIs, you might know Google Maps anytime you see

08:46.930 --> 08:48.770
Google Maps on a Web site,

08:48.940 --> 08:51.910
It's using the Google API.

08:51.950 --> 08:59.530
We also have a silly API like this one, one of my favorites, it's the Star Wars API. It shows you over

08:59.540 --> 09:11.880
here, if I do "people/2/", I get "C-3PO". If I do "people/3/", I get "R2-D2".

09:12.110 --> 09:15.600
I can also do "planets".

09:15.650 --> 09:24.740
This is a free nice to use API, so you can build a sample app using the Star Wars API and all you need

09:24.740 --> 09:36.050
to do is just fetch this resource, get the JSON converted to a JavaScript object and then style it and

09:36.050 --> 09:38.790
use it in your app whichever way you want.

09:40.490 --> 09:48.100
There's also some really important API is that if you're building serious web sites are really useful.

09:48.140 --> 09:49.740
This is the "stripe API".

09:49.910 --> 09:56.720
If you want to incorporate payments into your website, well, this shows you exactly what to do.

09:57.380 --> 10:01.590
And you can add to your server within whichever language you want.

10:01.590 --> 10:09.150
In our case, we're interested in Node and it tells you how you can add "stripe" as a payment method on

10:09.150 --> 10:09.820
your server.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.130
It sounds scary but it's all documented in here.

10:13.170 --> 10:16.030
It's step by step instructions of how to do it.

10:17.470 --> 10:28.910
Another one that I really like is the "Twilio API". And Twilio allows sending of messages on phones. So using

10:28.910 --> 10:34.770
something simple like this you can see there's not much to it other than using this client.messages.create

10:34.850 --> 10:36.420
that they provide.

10:36.710 --> 10:43.370
And we just say what we want the body of the text to be, to which number, from which number, if we want

10:43.370 --> 10:48.040
to include maybe an a heart, then we can add that as well.

10:48.170 --> 10:56.030
And let's say when a user signs up for a service. Well, we can send them a message by saying "hey we've

10:56.030 --> 10:57.620
created a new user.

10:57.620 --> 11:00.240
They've provided us their phone number.

11:00.350 --> 11:03.400
Send them a text message."

11:03.410 --> 11:07.510
Now you might be thinking this is almost too good to be true.

11:07.580 --> 11:12.020
You have so much power now you can just research APIs.

11:12.050 --> 11:16.640
And all the major Web sites have APIs data that they give to you.

11:16.670 --> 11:23.420
Well things like robohash, and Star Wars API. They're silly and they're fun and there's no real cost

11:23.420 --> 11:23.900
to them.

11:24.720 --> 11:31.440
But when you start building real applications and companies like stripe and Twilio where there's some

11:31.440 --> 11:39.360
real engineering effort behind creating these. Well, they charge. They charge a service and that's when

11:39.360 --> 11:45.960
you use something like an API key. And an API key looks like jibberish.

11:46.010 --> 11:54.270
It is a key, a private key so that every time you access their API they know that it's you.

11:54.410 --> 12:02.000
And because let's say you have a plan for making a thousand requests. They charge you because they can

12:02.000 --> 12:05.570
recognize you saying that "oh, this is Andreas key.

12:05.780 --> 12:11.720
He's the one making the request from a server and we're going to charge him for it". And don't worry.

12:11.720 --> 12:17.060
In our final project we're going to be using a really really cool machine learning API and we're going

12:17.060 --> 12:20.210
to generate our API key and actually use it.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.940
Luckily for us though it's free.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.350
So it's going to be a lot of fun.

12:26.220 --> 12:34.740
But from this video I want you to remember this. A server somewhere in the world for a company provides

12:35.190 --> 12:37.830
an API. In order for other people to use it,

12:37.830 --> 12:40.490
they usually tell you how to use it.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.630
And they have documentation on how to use it.

12:44.810 --> 12:51.830
But most of them comply with the standard like JSON to make it easier for developers like us to use.

12:52.130 --> 12:58.070
And at the end of the day, an API is a tool used for data communication.

12:58.160 --> 13:06.820
It's how a program or software or anything running code allows others to communicate with it. 

13:06.850 --> 13:15.740
It opens up a big possibility of making websites that do more than just list robots.

13:15.790 --> 13:24.670
You can now with the same principles build Web sites that incorporate different APIs to have the functionality

13:25.150 --> 13:28.570
of something like Skyscanner.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.150
I'll see you in the next one.

13:30.370 --> 13:30.590
Byebye
