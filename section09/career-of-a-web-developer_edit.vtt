WEBVTT

00:00.640 --> 00:07.060
Every decision that will require significant time of your life should be justified.

00:07.060 --> 00:11.860
And in this video we're going to talk about career of a web-developer.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.280
Now I'm going to be talking about three things specifically and this is a bit of a unique section unlike

00:17.280 --> 00:21.170
all the other ones where we just code along and learn new skills.

00:21.210 --> 00:23.880
I want to talk about three things in this video.

00:23.910 --> 00:27.160
One is why would you even want to be a developer.

00:27.180 --> 00:28.590
And I know you're taking the course.

00:28.590 --> 00:35.930
I know you're committed but I want to talk to you about why it is such a good decision to become a developer

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
and some of the freedom that it allows in your life.

00:39.330 --> 00:46.470
The second is we're going to talk about which tools you should learn to be a successful developer in

00:46.470 --> 00:47.420
2018.

00:47.760 --> 00:54.700
And then finally the third, we're going to talk about what career options there are out there currently.

00:54.780 --> 00:59.550
So let's tackle the first one why you would want to be a developer.

00:59.550 --> 01:03.300
Now I know a lot of people taking this course aren't necessarily from the States,

01:03.300 --> 01:04.280
I'm not either.

01:04.320 --> 01:11.430
But I wanted to show you how much in-demand a good developer is.

01:11.430 --> 01:17.670
Over here I have some salaries for developers around the states and you can see that as a Front-end Developer

01:18.940 --> 01:26.730
you have some really really nice salaries. A lot higher than most industries.

01:26.730 --> 01:31.800
And if you go to a Glassdoor, another website that's really really good to find out what salaries

01:31.800 --> 01:39.750
are - and you can do location specific to you and I have salaries in San Francisco which I know, I know

01:39.810 --> 01:43.400
they're way too inflated because to live there it's very expensive.

01:43.710 --> 01:48.710
But I do want to show you that there is a real value for developers out there.

01:48.720 --> 01:56.130
I've worked in the industry for many years and finding a job as a developer was quite frankly very easy

01:56.490 --> 02:00.520
and I'm not trying to be cocky or overconfident but it is true.

02:00.540 --> 02:08.180
Speak to any developer that knows his or her stuff and they're able to find jobs quite easily.

02:08.180 --> 02:14.760
And most times you're interviewing, you're interviewing the employer to see that this is a place that you

02:14.760 --> 02:17.360
would want to work because you have so many options.

02:17.700 --> 02:22.420
But you probably already know this you're taking this course for a reason.

02:22.450 --> 02:27.280
So let's talk about what you should learn in 2018.

02:28.550 --> 02:32.330
I have for you a couple of surveys here to show you the industry demand.

02:32.550 --> 02:34.060
The first one is from Jetbrains.

02:34.070 --> 02:42.310
A very very big software company and it talks about Javascript and which frameworks are the most popular.

02:43.650 --> 02:49.770
The one we're going to learn in this course is React and you can see here it is the most popular, is probably

02:49.770 --> 02:51.750
the most well respected.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.380
And a lot of big companies are using it.

02:55.410 --> 03:04.410
It was devolved at Facebook and now it is used by Netflix and a ton of other big companies that do big

03:04.410 --> 03:04.800
things technologically.

03:04.800 --> 03:12.150
You can also see that what editors and IDEs developers regularly use and we see that

03:12.150 --> 03:17.420
Sublime Text is number one and that is what we are using in this course.

03:17.430 --> 03:24.650
Let's take a look a Stackoverflow for those that don't know, Stackoverflow is probably the best 

03:24.660 --> 03:28.240
Website there is for developers. Throughout your career

03:28.300 --> 03:33.670
You'll go on to this website to ask questions and get answers almost daily.

03:33.670 --> 03:41.170
And one of the things that they do quite often is a survey and a Stackoverflow trance-analysis and

03:41.170 --> 03:49.600
you can see over here that Javascript is trending quite quite high all the way into this year and into

03:49.600 --> 03:52.120
next year it is a very in demand language.

03:52.120 --> 03:59.700
It can be used on the web, on mobile, on little devices, pretty much anywhere.

03:59.860 --> 04:04.350
If you can code Javascript you can code anything electronic

04:04.350 --> 04:05.620
at this point in time.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.170
So that is why we're learning Javascript.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.820
Let's look at the next one.

04:10.830 --> 04:11.450
This one is by Github.

04:11.450 --> 04:16.880
And you're going to get to know Github a lot better in the section that we will have

04:17.010 --> 04:23.760
for Github and Git, but I want to show you their stats on open source projects and you'll see that Javascript

04:24.060 --> 04:28.440
is in the lead with 2.3 million projects.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.340
I love the language.

04:30.340 --> 04:36.130
It's a great language to learn as your first one and it can take you really really far.

04:36.130 --> 04:41.980
Finally I made this little diagram for us just so you have a big picture of what we're going to learn

04:42.210 --> 04:43.480
in this course.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.500
We're going to learn basic skills like putting a website online.

04:46.510 --> 04:52.150
And terminal usage, Git and Github and RESTful Web services.

04:52.150 --> 04:59.050
We're also going to do front-end work and some of the videos have already gone through this 

04:59.050 --> 05:01.830
but we learn HTML5, CSS3.

05:02.110 --> 05:07.810
Now this is kind of interchangeable but if you want to be a designer you are more likely going to focus

05:07.810 --> 05:13.280
on CSS, responsive design and other tools like Photoshop, Sketch and Illustrator.

05:13.300 --> 05:18.240
And this is not the course for it, we are becoming developers.

05:18.310 --> 05:24.550
So we're going to learn Javascript instead and Javascript probably has a couple of libraries and frameworks

05:24.550 --> 05:32.770
that are really really popular and the ones used most often in mid-2000 was jQuery but that is now

05:32.770 --> 05:39.430
very outdated and you'll still see it here and there but you won't see a lot of the big top web sites using it.

05:39.430 --> 05:45.790
So we won't be focusing on that will just cover it slightly but it won't interest us because in 2018

05:46.390 --> 05:50.540
it is not really a, an employable skill to learn.

05:51.760 --> 05:58.480
And then I want to draw your attention to three other libraries and frameworks and what those are, are tools

05:58.870 --> 06:02.950
for developers to build web sites and web applications.

06:02.950 --> 06:08.620
And in this course we're going to learn React and you'll get to understand the technology behind that

06:08.620 --> 06:09.030
a lot more.

06:09.130 --> 06:15.960
But I chose React because it is currently the most popular way to build web applications.

06:16.270 --> 06:19.620
And the developer community around it is very very big.

06:19.840 --> 06:26.360
Angular.js was very popular a few years ago but it's kind of starting to die down right now.

06:26.440 --> 06:31.540
And I personally think there's a bigger future with React and some people may disagree.

06:31.560 --> 06:39.200
But having worked in the industry and seeing people's reaction to different technologies I really think

06:39.200 --> 06:43.840
React's going to go really far and you'll hear a ton about it in 2018.

06:44.210 --> 06:48.040
Vue.js is the up-and-comer that - it's fairly new,

06:48.040 --> 06:55.010
the community is a lot smaller so there is not as much information out there as there is for React but

06:55.010 --> 07:00.370
we won't be covering that topic again because we're focusing on the most employable skills.

07:00.710 --> 07:03.880
That is Javascript with React.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.730
Finally let's talk about career options.

07:07.980 --> 07:12.450
We're going to talk about the type of work that you will be able to get as a developer and some of the

07:12.450 --> 07:14.410
confusing job titles that are out there.

07:14.580 --> 07:19.860
So let's start off with the job titles. You might know what web-developer is because, well you've signed

07:19.860 --> 07:20.660
up for this course.

07:20.660 --> 07:26.920
That is somebody who works on the web, builds web sites builds, web applications.

07:27.030 --> 07:32.370
We also touched on the back-end developer - that is the person that works on the server works with some

07:32.370 --> 07:43.840
databases and they aren't too concerned with user facing side of a website or a web app. A full-stack developer

07:44.110 --> 07:48.510
is somebody that can work both on the frontend and backend and in this course.

07:48.510 --> 07:55.600
We're going to learn both frontend and backend. So you'll be able to call yourself a full-stack developer

07:55.810 --> 08:01.330
because you'll understand the full picture of how these web technologies work.

08:01.330 --> 08:03.320
We also have mobile developer,

08:03.670 --> 08:10.180
and the reason that I use React in this course is that even though it is a course geared towards web

08:10.180 --> 08:16.180
development using 90 percent of the things you'll learn with React you'll be able to build an Android

08:16.180 --> 08:20.210
app and an iOS app very easily.

08:20.290 --> 08:26.080
And then finally two things at the end here we have software developer and that is somebody that is

08:26.080 --> 08:32.620
able to build software not necessarily on the web, not necessarily on mobile.

08:32.680 --> 08:42.700
They're able to use a programming language to build software, that is code that can be run anywhere.

08:42.870 --> 08:50.450
And then finally the software engineers use computer science to solve complex machine problems.

08:51.370 --> 08:58.010
And that is a very very broad statement ah, but it is. 

08:58.030 --> 09:02.130
They're not necessarily good at one coding language they're good at working with machines.

09:02.530 --> 09:08.410
So I just wanted to throw that out there so you know what the differences are, when you are looking for

09:08.410 --> 09:10.290
jobs out there.

09:10.290 --> 09:12.260
Now let's talk about the fun stuff.

09:12.300 --> 09:19.780
The type of work you'll be able to do when you become a web developer and ideally if you go full force

09:19.780 --> 09:25.870
into this course and you really learn the concepts that we cover in this course the type of work that

09:26.200 --> 09:27.910
you can do with this.

09:27.910 --> 09:29.820
So the first one is entrepreneurship.

09:29.860 --> 09:36.250
And obviously when you're able to build web sites and you're able to build landing pages and applications,

09:36.640 --> 09:44.380
well you could start your own business if you have that ambition and idea, then entrepreneurship is definitely

09:44.380 --> 09:45.690
a good avenue to go.

09:45.850 --> 09:50.550
And it is part of the reason that I myself became a developer initially.

09:50.600 --> 09:57.530
The second one is startups if you want to work for young companies that are moving fast and creating

09:57.530 --> 10:05.570
some really cool technologies or innovations well, startups are always looking for developers.

10:05.570 --> 10:11.630
We also have 'Freelance' and that is being able to work on (your) own terms and you know using vebsites like

10:11.650 --> 10:18.640
Upwork to look for contract jobs and build quick projects for people around the world 

10:18.650 --> 10:18.980
as they need fit.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.520
And you know running a little business for yourself.

10:23.030 --> 10:30.680
The next one is working for the big tech companies, so that's Facebook, Google, Amazon if you're in the

10:30.680 --> 10:38.990
States. If you're somewhere else around the world you have your own big tech companies and they are always

10:39.140 --> 10:44.110
a great place to get hired as a developer because they have massive teams.

10:44.140 --> 10:51.190
They're solving really really big problems and they need all the developer knowledge that they can get.

10:51.200 --> 10:58.220
It is not for everybody but they are great places to be surrounded by really really smart people and

10:58.220 --> 10:59.020
learn from them.

10:59.970 --> 11:07.530
We also have ad agencies, so ad agencies always have contracts where they have a company that is working

11:07.530 --> 11:13.860
with them and they usually need some sort of a website or a promo site built for them and they have

11:13.950 --> 11:19.230
staff developers that help them work on these different projects with different clients.

11:19.560 --> 11:24.000
And then finally I bolded this and that is remote work.

11:24.030 --> 11:30.450
I know a lot of developers that get into devolvement because of this ideal of being able to work remotely

11:30.450 --> 11:33.530
and, you know what, that is absolutely true.

11:33.690 --> 11:38.940
If that is the type of life that you want and that is the type of career that you want, working remotely

11:38.940 --> 11:46.470
is definitely something that a developer is able to do, because lets be honest, to be a developer all

11:46.470 --> 11:52.470
you need is an Internet connection and you don't necessarily need to be face to face with a client or

11:52.470 --> 11:58.710
with a coworker with an employer because like I said everything is on a computer.

11:58.770 --> 12:07.490
So that is not for everybody but it is an option and it is an attractive option for some. 

12:07.490 --> 12:15.920
So what was the meaning of this video then? Well we went over a few things because I wanted you to understand what we

12:15.920 --> 12:22.610
are doing in this course but there's an important point I really want to emphasize, that is to keep in

12:22.610 --> 12:30.050
mind that when you start off something like learning devolvement skills the first two months will feel

12:30.050 --> 12:33.000
like you are climbing an insurmountable mountain.

12:33.170 --> 12:39.530
Every video or course or tutorial or book that you read is going to make you feel like you're the only

12:39.530 --> 12:42.110
person in the world that doesn't know this stuff.

12:42.190 --> 12:45.440
But I'm here to tell you to stay strong.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.790
I went through it, every single developer has gone through it.

12:48.830 --> 12:56.370
You'll get there and you will have more and more 'aha!' moments as time progresses and we even have a word

12:56.370 --> 13:01.590
for this in the industry it's called the 'imposter syndrome' where you feel like you're the only one who

13:01.590 --> 13:03.090
doesn't know this information.

13:04.150 --> 13:08.620
Rest assured we all feel this way when we learn something new.

13:08.650 --> 13:14.050
What you'll learn is that being a good developer isn't necessarily memorizing a whole bunch of documentation

13:14.050 --> 13:15.220
or code.

13:15.220 --> 13:20.240
It's about learning how to solve problems using all the tools that are available to you.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.580
And I'm going to leave you with that.

13:23.350 --> 13:25.590
Being a developer isn't easy.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.020
You really do need to know your stuff.

13:28.060 --> 13:34.470
So follow along this course and really engage in all the lessons and all the exercises.

13:34.570 --> 13:42.220
And if you have questions, ask them, because in-demand developers are problem solvers not just coders.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.920
Can't wait to see you in the next video. Bye-bye
