00:01.000 --> 00:06.340
Welcome to another developer fundamental video. I think you know what that means.

00:06.410 --> 00:07.970
"How's it going John?"

00:08.230 --> 00:10.640
"Not bad partner. Follow me I'll cover you."

00:10.850 --> 00:19.710
A developer needs to solve problems that there aren't clear answers to. 

00:19.770 --> 00:23.730
The best developers are the ones who are left to their own devices to figure out a problem.

00:23.900 --> 00:28.760
They are able to find errors in their code and solve it themselves.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.530
They have questions or something they don't understand.

00:31.710 --> 00:32.990
Well no problem.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.750
They know how to use the resources they have to figure it out.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.270
At the end of the day we are engineers.

00:40.440 --> 00:44.730
This is what we do and this is a developer fundamental.

00:44.880 --> 00:50.720
How can we solve this problem you're having when I'm not around to answer these questions for you.

00:50.970 --> 00:54.140
So how can you practice this?

00:54.180 --> 00:57.280
Let me introduce you to your most important resource

00:57.300 --> 01:06.130
as a developer: Stackoverflow. Stackoverflow is probably in the top five most used tools by any developer.

01:06.820 --> 01:13.640
Whether you're a game developer or a network admin a security expert or a web developer.

01:13.750 --> 01:19.090
Every day people in the field post questions you get answers from some of the best in the world.

01:19.480 --> 01:25.530
The website is so extensive that the question you have is most likely already asked and answered.

01:25.650 --> 01:32.250
I can't remember how many times stackoverflow has saved me when I was stuck on a problem.

01:32.670 --> 01:37.590
So in this short video I want to show you an important skill a developer should have - that is problem solving.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.260
In real life, You don't have a teacher or

01:39.260 --> 01:44.320
an instructor you can just ask for an answer every time you are stuck.

01:44.460 --> 01:50.170
No, most likely you have to figure things out yourself using the tools at your disposal.

01:50.890 --> 01:55.420
I'm not joking when I say most developers spend half their time on google.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.260
I want to start practicing that muscle.

01:58.330 --> 02:00.250
When you have a question ask yourself,

02:00.460 --> 02:06.700
"Knowing what I know and the tools at my disposal what is the best way for me to get to the end - to solve

02:06.700 --> 02:07.540
this problem?"

02:07.540 --> 02:15.810
The first step when you are stumped is to Google. And most likely one of the first links that pops up

02:15.900 --> 02:23.430
if you include the word Javascript or CSS or HTML 

02:23.430 --> 02:24.140
well most likely one of the first links will be stackoverflow.

02:24.330 --> 02:28.740
So let me show you an example and take you through a real life scenario.

02:28.740 --> 02:35.020
I've got a piece of text which is a string and I need to find how many exclamation marks it has.

02:35.400 --> 02:49.320
Well again just Google something along the lines of "check if string contains substring javascript".

02:49.600 --> 02:50.660
So I just Googled this.

02:50.650 --> 02:51.940
Let's see what pops up.

02:52.070 --> 02:58.410
And yeah we have a whole bunch of things, and you can see that the first two links are stackoverflow.

02:58.520 --> 03:02.010
So I would click on this and see that,

03:02.300 --> 03:08.360
all right the question is, you know, "I would expect a string that contains method but there doesn't seem

03:08.360 --> 03:10.760
to be one." well, Javascript doesn't have one.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.650
And people have answered this and you can see over here that there's a few things.

03:16.670 --> 03:21.350
One while there's 49 answers that's a lot there's votes, that's all this.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.300
It's active.

03:22.310 --> 03:27.960
I usually like looking at the both because the top answer will have the most upvotes.

03:27.980 --> 03:30.640
You can see here that this person has a ton.

03:30.770 --> 03:31.880
It also has a checkmark.

03:31.880 --> 03:37.610
This checkmark means that the person who asked the question has verified that this infact works.

03:37.760 --> 03:45.680
And usually I like looking at the top answer and 

03:45.680 --> 03:45.920
then kind of browsing through the second answer as well.

03:45.920 --> 03:52.990
Just make sure that I didn't miss anything because sometimes when new things happen this question might

03:52.990 --> 03:54.440
have been ask let's see when it was asked.

03:54.450 --> 03:55.780
It was asked eight years ago.

03:55.910 --> 04:02.720
Maybe the top answer since then, maybe Javascript included a contains method that we can use on strings

04:02.720 --> 04:06.710
and maybe the top answer now isn't exactly the top answer anymore.

04:06.830 --> 04:11.930
So I like scrolling through or making sure that you know maybe the first three answers are good but

04:12.020 --> 04:17.390
if you scroll up over here we see that this person actually kept updating their answer and even has

04:17.390 --> 04:20.340
the ES6 method "includes".

04:20.690 --> 04:26.870
So now that I know I see that, oh! I can just use the 'includes' function and with the 'includes' function

04:27.200 --> 04:30.310
I can just do something like this.

04:30.350 --> 04:33.080
I can say does the string

04:35.640 --> 04:38.060
"Helloooo!" with an exclamation mark.

04:38.220 --> 04:44.210
Well does "Helloooo!" have an exclamation mark?

04:47.360 --> 04:55.060
and I get an error, well because if I look over here it's not 'include' it is 'includes'. Let me try that again

04:55.480 --> 04:56.540
and I get 'true'.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.540
If I do a let's say an 'a'.

05:00.910 --> 05:03.340
I get 'false' because well, it doesn't including anything.

05:03.490 --> 05:05.490
So there you go stackoverflow

05:05.560 --> 05:08.060
just answered my question.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.360
And you can see over here there's a few other things that you can look at.

05:11.380 --> 05:19.240
One is, you can look at some of the comments that people have made and comments usually have votes as

05:19.240 --> 05:22.860
well so I like looking at comments with a lot of votes.

05:23.030 --> 05:27.390
And you can see people have provided valuable links.

05:27.410 --> 05:34.730
You also see that on the right hand side you have linked answer so maybe this page doesn't answer you

05:34.760 --> 05:41.520
but stackoverflow is smart enough to say, "Hey! maybe this is why you're looking for:" 

05:41.520 --> 05:42.800
and you have 'related' you have a ton.

05:42.840 --> 05:48.390
The last thing I want to point out is you also want to look at usually the person that's answering. 

05:48.390 --> 05:56.810
You see that 'Fabien' which has a lot of gold stars and a lot of points on stackoverflow,

05:57.060 --> 05:58.160
well this person answering.

05:58.170 --> 06:01.620
This person looks pretty pretty credible from all their stats.

06:01.620 --> 06:07.770
So that is most likely a good answer by this and actually know a few companies that look at stackoverflow profiles

06:07.770 --> 06:14.310
to see how good of a developer a person is, because if you're a developer that answers questions

06:14.310 --> 06:17.870
on stackoverflow and provide a lot of value,

06:18.120 --> 06:20.120
well, you must be a good developer.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.380
So remember this Googling and stackoverflow is very important.

06:24.420 --> 06:30.240
If you don't find the answer there you can create an account and 

06:30.240 --> 06:31.110
ask yourself the question on stackoverflow.

06:31.320 --> 06:35.310
But better yet go to the zero-to-mastery Slack chat

06:41.810 --> 06:44.750
and if your question wasn't answered on stackoverflow

06:48.640 --> 06:55.460
again, go to our community here and you have a ton of channels that you can ask questions in.

06:55.540 --> 07:01.860
For example if you are on channels of here you'll see all the channels that we have if you have

07:01.870 --> 07:08.830
Bootstrap questions, if you have Github questions, you go into the community and you ask all your questions.

07:08.830 --> 07:11.420
The Javascript channel is always always active.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.590
Very very helpful people on there.

07:13.660 --> 07:20.250
And remember you have a community of developers even after you're done with this course

07:20.290 --> 07:21.400
where they're willing to help you.

07:21.670 --> 07:27.470
So it is good to practice not just asking questions all the time but discovering answers yourself.

07:27.730 --> 07:29.710
Learn to debug your own code.

07:29.890 --> 07:35.720
Develop them muscle and you'll be a great developer.

07:35.820 --> 07:36.040
See you in the next one. Bye-bye
