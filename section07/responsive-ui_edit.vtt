Welcome back! Whenever you have a request from an employer to build a website or a web app, one of

00:06.540 --> 00:15.170
the first things that they will ask for is to make sure that your website is responsive. So what is responsive UI?

00:15.270 --> 00:20.760
Well I can show you by opening up the developer tools, which we should know by now and you'll see over

00:20.760 --> 00:24.630
here that there is a little phone icon.

00:25.020 --> 00:32.350
If we click on this, it will show you why your web site will look like on say, an iPhone.

00:32.440 --> 00:33.740
Let's make this a little bit bigger.

00:33.760 --> 00:38.160
So let's do 100% of the size. Perfect.

00:38.170 --> 00:42.840
You'll see that your website on an iPhone looks like this.

00:43.150 --> 00:50.050
And if we do an iPad. Well it looks like this and if it rotates, it looks good.

00:50.170 --> 00:58.840
So responsive means that your web site, no matter what, whether it's on the big screen or something like

00:58.840 --> 01:00.650
an iPad.

01:00.750 --> 01:01.680
It is responsive.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.810
That means there's no cut-offs.

01:03.810 --> 01:08.540
Everything looks good no matter what size the screen is.

01:08.550 --> 01:15.480
So if we go back to our web site and close the developer tabs, I can actually play around with this - open

01:15.510 --> 01:17.820
and close and see that it's responsive.

01:17.820 --> 01:20.840
The website looks good, no matter what the size.

01:20.850 --> 01:27.810
And users can enjoy the experience and not be turned off, because whether they're accessing it through

01:28.140 --> 01:32.400
their iPad, at home, on their couch it still looks good.

01:32.430 --> 01:38.360
So keep that in mind: responsive UI should be a priority when building websites.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.110
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
