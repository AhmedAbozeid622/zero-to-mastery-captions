00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.250
Opowiem Ci teraz jak będzie wygladał ten kurs.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.310
Każda część posiada pewne czynności, które możesz 
wykonać jak na przykład tworzenie stron internetowych

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.479
oraz przykładowych projektów, wszystko czego używamy w tym kursie
to narzędzia używane w firmach w prawdziwej pracy.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.640
To najlepsze dostępne narzędzia. 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.070
Spójrzmy więc na program kursu.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.189
Pierwsza część to wprowadzenie.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.760
Kilka podstawowych pojęć, które pozwolą nam zapoznać się z siecią
i jak ona działa.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.910
Zaczniemy od tego, jak działa internet,
oraz historii tej techniki.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.139
Opowiem o historii sieci, o przeglądarkach internetowych
Chcę byś zrozumiał

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.980
podstawowe pojęcia związane z internetem i jak aktualna technika
rozwinęła się do obecnego poziomu.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.789
Następnie będziemy uczyć się HTML5.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.509
Wreszcie, budując naszą pierwszą stronę poznamy trochę 
zaawansowanego HTML-a i stworzymy

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.160
złożone formularze dzięki czemu będziesz naprawdę dobry w tej technice.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.850
Następnie przejdziemy do CSS, który pozwala nadać styl naszym stronom i uczynić je pięknymi.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.969
Kolejno przejdziemy do zaawansowanego CSS, 
gdzie używając funkcji CSS3 jak przejścia i gradienty

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.570
w części zaawansowanej CSS stworzymy 
projekt generatora tła, który będzie świetną zabawą.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.379
Po opanowaniu pracy ze stronami internetowymi 
przy użyciu HTML i CSS przejdziemy do nauki

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.249
Bootstrap 4, szablonów i budowania strony internetowej Twojego startupu, 
która przyjmuje adresy e-mail

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.229
i zapisuje adresy e-mail uzytkowników jako 
osób zainteresowanych Twoim startupem.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.520
Bardzo przydatna umiejętność, której
na pewno będziesz potrzebował w swojej karierze.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.349
Lub jeśli masz pomysł na biznes,
który chcesz zrealizować.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:57.109
Zagłębimy się również w najnowsze funkcje CSS
jak flexbox, mój ulubiony CSS grid i staniesz się naprawdę

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.039
dobry w tworzeniu responsywnych układów z CSS.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.230
Wreszcie kończymy część pierwszą 
omawiając karierę programisty.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.390
Co właściwie wiąże się z karierą programisty.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.770
Jakie są wynagrodzenia.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.999
Jakie są różnice pomiędzy software developerem, 
programistą urządzeń mobilnych, inzynierem oprogramowania,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.469
full stack developerem.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.179
We're going to cover all that
and we're also going to talk about the future trends and what skills do

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.269
you need in the future. From part one
we move to our next section in here we'll start to introduce

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.139
JavaScript and learn concepts that allow us to learn
a real programming language and the most popular

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.880
programming language which is JavaScript.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.770
We then move to DOM manipulation
where we'll actually use JavaScript to create actions and behaviors

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.610
to our websites.

00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:47.770
So they're interactive.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.750
And then finally we're going to learn some
advanced JavaScript concepts so that we can use JavaScript

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.140
to control the machines around us.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.979
Now just knowing HTML, CSS and JavaScript
is not good enough and you won't be able to grow in your

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.400
role and command a higher salary just with those three skills.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.789
I'm going to be teaching you these things coming up
because these are the things you should know so

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.680
that you are miles ahead of the rest.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.439
So after the JavaScript section we're going to start
getting into the command line and working with

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.160
the terminal.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.290
We then learn about developer environments
and I'll actually show you what my developer environment

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.930
on my computer looks like when I'm working.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.989
We'll be setting up our own computers
with all the tools necessary of a real life developer so you can

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.979
use the same setup when you go and work
for somebody or for yourself.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.469
We will then learn about Git and GitHub.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.710
Probably the most important tools of a developer
and I'll show you how teams work with these technologies

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.949
to create collaborative software.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.540
We then get into a fun section
which is a day in the life of a developer.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.890
I'll show you what a day today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
what it looks like and what tools you'll use.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.399
I will take you through a sample day at a tech company
just so that's on your first day of the job.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.730
You won't be surprised.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.049
We will then jump to NPM and NPM scripts
a way for developers to share their code and it's going to

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.200
open up a whole world of possibilities in this section.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.959
We're also going to create
our own customizable portfolio project.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.620
So moving forward you can add the projects from this course
to your website and have it as your online

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.140
resume.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.690
Finally we finish off part two with React.js

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.600
You'll learn the library that companies like
Netflix, Facebook and Instagram used to build fast

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.899
scalable applications.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.260
This is one of the highest
in demand skills in the industry.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.570
It's so much fun.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.810
And I'm really really excited about
that section from part two.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.950
We'll move on to the world outside of just the front-end
and we're going to learn about HTTP JSON AJAX

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.100
something that will open up
a world of possibilities.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.570
We'll learn about the back-end basics
and what back-end developers do.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.420
And then finally I'll introduce you to some APIs
what APIs are and definitely some really interesting

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.039
APIs that are out there.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.919
This section is really going to open up your world
from just being a front-end developer that is really

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.989
good at building websites to somebody
that can create really dynamic applications.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.449
And it will set us up for Part 4.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.800
This is where it gets really really fun.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.759
We're gonna start working on our final project called
smart brain and we're gonna start off by working

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.879
on the front-end that is using
CSS, JavaScript, HTML and react.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.290
We're going to build an image recognition app
that's gonna be really really fun.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:56.979
You submit a URL and using a machine learning API
we're gonna detect to see if in that photo there

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.620
is a face and then detect where that faces with a square box.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.519
We're gonna create a sign-in form a registration form
and it's gonna be really really impressive something

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.579
that you're gonna be able to use in your portfolio
and impress future employers or clients.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.020
We then take a break from the smart brain project to introduce you to Node.js and Express.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.129
This is where I show you how to build a server
how to create a RESTful API so that when we get into

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:31.129
the next section the smart brain server section
we build our own server so that we're actually able

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:39.649
to communicate with the server over HTTP
and sign in to our app sign out have profiles and do all sorts

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.920
of really interesting things. From there

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.599
we again take a break and learn about databases
a really complex topic but I'm going to make it simple

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.270
for you to understand how they work and in the next section
we're actually going to create our own database

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:01.189
using Postgres and connected to our server
so that at the end you'll have a fully working app that

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:09.379
has a front-end client website, a back-end server
and a server that's working with a database. Pretty

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.839
much a full fledged application.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.239
And finally we're going to deploy and launch
that application so you know exactly how to put a real

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.479
life app that is secure and won't get hacked on the web
and don't worry I'm going to provide all files

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.269
for you throughout the sections so that you can just
add them to your portfolio or you can work along

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.780
the videos as well depending on
what your learning style is.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.690
You can follow along whichever way
works best for you.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.139
And at the end of the course I'm also going to have
a quick little section of some of my favorite resources

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.950
to get hired.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.879
Some of my own advice on finding a job of your dreams.
By the end of this course you're going to learn

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.350
the skills that allow you to apply
for jobs in the following roles:

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.570
web developer, software developer, front-end developer,
javascript developer or a full-stack developer

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.840
You're going to learn the technologies that are
actually being used behind tech companies.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.559
You're going to be able to build
your own websites and applications.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.509
But most importantly you're going to master
fundamental concepts in web development so that it sets

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.329
you up for a bright long career.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.879
I also want to make this course interactive.
I'll be making videos of student projects and what others

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.380
have built in this course like you.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:28.099
I'll also have Q&amp;A videos where based on the most popular questions
or the most popular topics I'm

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:35.350
going to create new videos as they are suggested.
We have a lot to cover but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.530
Zaczynami.
