Welcome back.

00:02.640 --> 00:08.410
I want to just take a second to say good job getting this far.

00:09.650 --> 00:17.160
I know it's not easy just following a voice and a screen and that requires a lot of motivation.

00:17.170 --> 00:20.010
So again thank you for sticking in there.

00:20.170 --> 00:25.780
I really hope that you've learned a lot in this and you're excited to learn even more.

00:27.380 --> 00:35.330
You see we're able to start from just simple HTML to building our database and connecting it to

00:35.330 --> 00:42.320
a server and creating this beautiful app that you can now see how much potential we have we can really

00:42.320 --> 00:44.590
expand this to do so many things.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.520
And that is why being a developer is so amazing.

00:47.660 --> 00:52.930
You literally have the power to do anything you want whatever you want to build.

00:52.940 --> 00:55.850
There is a way and I hope you really got that.

00:56.090 --> 01:02.090
Now this app of ours there really is a lot that can be improved.

01:02.100 --> 01:11.240
There is a ton of things that we can clean up a lot of validation that we'll need to fix and some optimizations

01:12.640 --> 01:18.720
but following somebody on a project can get pretty daunting.

01:18.770 --> 01:20.160
So I want to hear from you.

01:20.180 --> 01:25.220
I want to hear why you want to see next how we would like to improve this app.

01:25.250 --> 01:31.310
Maybe you want to create sessions so that if I come back to this app I don't have to log in every single

01:31.310 --> 01:33.610
time.

01:33.720 --> 01:37.340
Maybe you want to just expand on this and create a user profile.

01:38.230 --> 01:41.730
So that we can update and delete users.

01:43.500 --> 01:49.140
Let me know what you think you want to do in this course because I want this to be fluid.

01:49.140 --> 01:52.200
I wanted to learn things say you are actually interested in.

01:52.260 --> 01:58.730
So let me know and I will keep working on this app with whatever new features you want to add.

02:00.470 --> 02:04.650
But again good job you've gotten this far.

02:04.650 --> 02:10.900
Boy it definitely took me a long time to record these videos and I'm glad that we got here as well.

02:11.030 --> 02:13.490
But there's so much more to learn.

02:14.810 --> 02:15.870
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye.
