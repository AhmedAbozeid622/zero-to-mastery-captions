WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:01.730
Welcome back.

00:01.890 --> 00:05.450
It's time to get back to building web pages.

00:05.670 --> 00:09.050
But this time with JavaScript.

00:09.330 --> 00:15.030
Up until now we've learned HTML and CSS and then we learned JavaScript

00:15.240 --> 00:22.380
but separately. The true power though comes when we combine all these three technologies. Now the previous

00:22.380 --> 00:29.370
videos I mentioned how JavaScript allowed actions to be performed on the webpage. Well what did they

00:29.370 --> 00:30.030
mean there?

00:31.040 --> 00:37.090
By adding JavaScript to our web pages we now have the power that we never had with HTML

00:37.130 --> 00:43.790
and CSS. We can change all the HTML elements in the page,

00:43.980 --> 00:51.120
we can change all the HTML attributes in the page, change all the CSS styles on the page,

00:51.120 --> 00:59.400
remove existing HTML elements and attributes, add new HTML elments and attributes and JavaScript

00:59.400 --> 01:08.570
can also react to existing HTML events or it can create its own HTML events on the page.

01:08.580 --> 01:15.370
Now some of these things like changing CSS tiles or HTML attributes and elements.

01:15.380 --> 01:24.710
Well we could kind of do them before but with JavaScript we can do this while the user is on the page.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.410
Let's look at the diagram.

01:27.580 --> 01:34.300
We requested the HTML and then the web browser saw the link tag.

01:34.700 --> 01:46.320
Grab the CSS and before we use JavaScript if we wanted to change the style or change how the HTML looked.

01:46.320 --> 01:49.100
Maybe we want to click on the 'About' page.

01:49.120 --> 02:01.530
While we would request the HTML and the CSS us all over again to change how the web page looked but now

02:02.190 --> 02:10.650
with JavaScript all you need is this and JavaScript can do that all for you if you want it to all on

02:10.650 --> 02:12.070
the same page.

02:12.120 --> 02:16.260
Now in this section we're going to learn all of that. In order to do that

02:16.260 --> 02:21.090
though we must go back to our diagrams and understand two things.

02:21.150 --> 02:26.780
One is the DOM and the second is the JavaScript engine.

02:26.850 --> 02:34.140
Up to this point we spoke how HTML gets requested then CSS, then the browser does something special, it

02:34.140 --> 02:36.340
creates something called the DOM.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.160
That kind of looks like this.

02:39.340 --> 02:45.860
When a web page is loaded the browser creates the DOM which stands for Document Object Model.

02:46.060 --> 02:50.880
You see over here that we have document with the root element HTML.

02:51.070 --> 02:56.460
We have a head element, body element with some 'a' tags and 'h1' tags.

02:56.470 --> 02:58.000
What does this really mean?

02:58.030 --> 03:01.520
You can actually see the same thing in the console, so let's check that out.

03:03.110 --> 03:08.990
So the DOM or the Document Object Model is simply 'document'.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.490
So over here if we open up the document there you go.

03:12.560 --> 03:17.440
We have the same thing that we saw in the elements tab. Let me close the style over here.

03:18.530 --> 03:24.890
Right in the console.

03:24.990 --> 03:27.580
Now why do we need the DOM?

03:27.720 --> 03:37.050
Well we needed a way to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements, so the DOM was created so we can do something

03:37.050 --> 03:39.070
like this.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.530
'document.write("helloooo")'

03:44.170 --> 03:51.590
and watch what happens to the web page, it changes to

03:51.730 --> 03:52.590
"helloooo".

03:52.600 --> 04:00.700
So the DOM is something a browser creates to allow us to modify the HTML and CSS.

04:00.970 --> 04:04.420
OK now what about the other phrase that I mentioned,

04:04.420 --> 04:07.770
the JavaScript engine? Well up to this point

04:07.770 --> 04:14.540
we talked about how each browser loads up JavaScript and it magically reads it.

04:14.570 --> 04:16.490
What does that even mean?

04:16.690 --> 04:24.110
Well each browser has a thing called 'JavaScript engine' and they all have pretty cool names.

04:24.110 --> 04:35.710
Chrome has 'V8 engine', Edge has 'Chalker Core', Safari has 'Nitro' and Firefox has 'SpiderMonkey'. And what

04:35.720 --> 04:43.670
they do is they are the ones that look at the JavaScript file and read it line by line and execute the

04:43.670 --> 04:44.830
JavaScript.

04:44.840 --> 04:48.300
So how do these two tie together?

04:48.530 --> 04:53.400
Well now we can use JavaScript to talk with the DOM.

04:53.540 --> 04:56.960
You see when we did document dot write (document.write)

05:00.220 --> 05:02.110
that was JavaScript wasn't it?

05:02.140 --> 05:09.390
That looks like an object and it had the write method that accepted an argument

05:09.430 --> 05:18.250
'helloooo'. Web browsers allow us to access the DOM through the document object and that's what it is it's

05:18.250 --> 05:19.330
an object.

05:19.420 --> 05:26.710
And now we have the power that we mentioned before to do all the things to essentially modify how our

05:26.830 --> 05:29.410
web page looks.

05:29.410 --> 05:38.530
So knowing what we do, document is the screen that we see in the browser. Right over here and the document

05:38.650 --> 05:41.210
as I mentioned is just an object.

05:41.500 --> 05:48.520
Now does it have a parent object? Well as a matter of fact

05:48.580 --> 05:48.940
it does.

05:48.940 --> 05:51.850
It's called a window.

05:52.090 --> 05:59.610
And you see over here a window is an object with a whole ton of properties.

05:59.810 --> 06:08.130
But if we scroll to here we see that one of the properties is document and it even highlights it for

06:08.130 --> 06:13.790
us and if we open up the document it has more properties.

06:13.830 --> 06:24.730
Also, remember 'alert' and 'prompt' look at that the window object has alert.

06:24.790 --> 06:26.570
So let's try something.

06:26.790 --> 06:34.960
If I did 'window.alert("check check")' will this still work?

06:34.960 --> 06:39.920
Let's see? Yep it still works.

06:39.960 --> 06:49.790
The reason that 'alert' worked like this was because 'window' is - you can think of it as the big parent of

06:49.800 --> 06:59.680
everything and a browser window is an object that describes this browser and anytime you use a method

07:00.070 --> 07:08.210
like 'alert' if you don't specify anything it assumes that you're talking about the window object,

07:08.370 --> 07:16.410
the biggest parent. But remember 'document.write'?

07:17.730 --> 07:25.340
Can we do that on the window object?

07:25.460 --> 07:31.100
Let's check this. I get an error 'window.write'

07:31.110 --> 07:36.410
is not a function because it doesn't exist as a property of 'window'

07:36.420 --> 07:43.310
tt exists as a property of document which is a property of 'window'.

07:43.320 --> 07:54.580
So let's recap. A web browser has a window object that has a property 'document' that specifies what should

07:54.580 --> 07:58.390
get displayed to decide what to get displayed

07:58.390 --> 08:10.030
the document object, the document object model reads the HTML and CSS and then JavaScript that is read

08:10.360 --> 08:13.590
line by line by something like a JavaScript engine -

08:13.600 --> 08:17.380
In Google Chrome that's the V-8 engine - reads through it.

08:17.770 --> 08:27.400
And if it ever needs to change anything JavaScript can speak with the document object and modify the

08:27.600 --> 08:33.850
HTML and CSS. Using our new found power, in the next video

08:33.940 --> 08:40.510
we're going to start manipulating the DOM to make our websites more interactive with JavaScript.

08:40.510 --> 08:42.100
Let's get started. Bye-bye
