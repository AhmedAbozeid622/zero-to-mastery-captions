Welcome to the fifth developer fundamental. You're still going strong and I'm proud of you.

00:07.170 --> 00:10.770
You just got through the toughest section which is DOM manipulation.

00:10.800 --> 00:17.760
But before we get going, I want to talk to you about another developer fundamental, which is accessing

00:17.970 --> 00:25.330
the DOM. Javascript and oh sorry I think we got John. How's it going John? "You and what army?"

00:25.490 --> 00:26.110
All right.

00:26.180 --> 00:32.270
Back to what we're talking about - Javascript in the HTML make things on the Web very exciting with all

00:32.270 --> 00:33.230
the things you can do.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.530
But it also introduced a whole slew of problems.

00:36.710 --> 00:39.110
One was innerHTML here.

00:39.620 --> 00:45.820
Every time innerHTML is set the HTML has to be parsed,

00:46.100 --> 00:51.000
a DOM constructed and inserted into the document.

00:51.020 --> 00:52.420
Now what does that mean?

00:52.430 --> 01:01.740
Well, we need to recreate this tree and then add it to the Web browser and then have everything in here

01:01.750 --> 01:03.660
show up on the Web page.

01:03.910 --> 01:08.110
I mean Web browsers are fast but they still have to do work.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.620
This takes time.

01:09.640 --> 01:17.200
For example if element let's say here has the tag 'a',

01:17.290 --> 01:26.190
and there's thousands of these in the DOM tree if you call this dot innerHTML, it's going

01:26.190 --> 01:30.870
to cause the Parser to re-parse everything all over again.

01:31.230 --> 01:37.450
And this could break references to maybe click events and cause other chaos.

01:37.470 --> 01:42.760
In reality all you want to do is attach a single new element to the end.

01:43.950 --> 01:51.070
And innerHTML is also susceptible to some attacks called cross-site scripting which is a security problem.

01:52.260 --> 01:58.680
Now as more and more websites try to make their Web page do more than just show a page, think a Web

01:58.680 --> 02:01.170
app, like Udemy here.

02:01.560 --> 02:06.570
There's obviously a lot more going on than just text and style.

02:06.700 --> 02:13.050
They access the DOM and change things quite a lot but this is a huge performance problem.

02:13.300 --> 02:19.060
In the previous videos we learned that we want to make performant and fast websites in this day and

02:19.060 --> 02:23.500
age by minimizing the amount of backend requests we make.

02:23.500 --> 02:32.070
So if you remember we learned that the location of servers is important, how many trips we make to grab

02:32.280 --> 02:36.560
all the files is important, and the size of the files matter.

02:36.560 --> 02:44.980
Now in this lesson we want to minimize the amount of DOM manipulation we make. If we change, let's say one

02:44.980 --> 02:45.750
drop down,

02:45.810 --> 02:48.340
we don't want the whole page to re-render.

02:48.540 --> 02:55.200
We want to have an interactive website but not necessarily make the Web browser work because we're

02:55.200 --> 03:00.400
constantly changing things to the document object.

03:00.410 --> 03:01.700
Let's see what I'm talking about

03:01.700 --> 03:03.650
by showing you an example.

03:03.650 --> 03:11.450
If I open up the console here, and I can actually press escape and you'll see that it toggles a new bar

03:12.770 --> 03:18.380
and you might not see rendering you might have to click here, and select the rendering you'll be able

03:18.380 --> 03:21.340
to do something called Paint flashing.

03:21.520 --> 03:33.430
And now if I minimize this, every time this turns green it means something's being repainted on the Web page

03:34.150 --> 03:37.450
and you can see over here, as I'm scrolling through everything,

03:40.410 --> 03:43.080
all the green actions happening.

03:43.350 --> 03:46.590
And that's a lot, of a lot of things.

03:46.600 --> 03:53.320
And Udemy does a good job of making sure that when I do this only this section that I'm actually

03:53.320 --> 04:01.830
touching gets...gets painted. So play around with it if you want and check out some different websites. Some

04:01.830 --> 04:04.040
websites you'll notice when you scroll...

04:04.270 --> 04:08.330
it'll re-renders the whole thing instead of just the bar as you can see here.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.170
But that is your lesson.

04:12.540 --> 04:17.870
You want to minimize the amount of DOM manipulation and events.

04:17.920 --> 04:24.160
It's a very important concept in building Web apps, and you also want to be smart and use the best methods

04:24.580 --> 04:27.190
to minimize this. Now,

04:27.280 --> 04:32.350
luckily for you that is exactly why REACT was created.

04:32.350 --> 04:36.220
You'll learn more about it in that section but get excited.

04:36.220 --> 04:40.340
It's going to make things really really fast and really simple to build.

04:41.650 --> 04:42.220
OK.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.750
That's it for now.

04:44.020 --> 04:44.710
Until next time. Bye Bye
