00:00.450 --> 00:07.400
Welcome back. In this video we're finally going to put our front end application on a server so that

00:07.430 --> 00:15.780
everything is now off of our computer online and we can share our project with the world to get started.

00:15.780 --> 00:25.420
We can go back to Heroku and in our dashboard we can simply see that we have our server but we want

00:25.420 --> 00:36.220
to create a new app and this new app we can call it smart brain. We'll choose region in us we'll click

00:36.250 --> 00:45.370
Create app and it gives us really really nice commands how to set up everything we can just do Heroku

00:45.460 --> 00:47.530
login.

00:47.630 --> 00:51.250
So let's do that from our smart brain front end.

00:52.510 --> 00:57.140
I'm going to say Heroku login

01:04.060 --> 01:06.680
log in with my email and my password

01:09.510 --> 01:16.650
and going back to the readme we see that we make sure that our git is set up which it is and we can add

01:16.650 --> 01:25.320
our remote to Heroku gid remote smart brain right.

01:25.420 --> 01:31.630
If we do get remote dash V and these are the same steps that we ran with our API server as well.

01:31.690 --> 01:35.310
We see that we have Heroku next.

01:35.350 --> 01:40.720
We want to do git add commit and then push Hiroku Master.

01:40.740 --> 01:41.880
All right.

01:41.970 --> 01:47.580
And a reminder here that even though we haven't changed anything on the front end we do have to run

01:47.580 --> 01:51.870
and git add and git commit.

01:52.050 --> 01:55.140
Otherwise the changes won't appear on Hiroku.

01:55.140 --> 02:01.590
So let's just say deploy for now and then we can just to git push Heroku master.

02:05.850 --> 02:07.810
Seems a little bit too easy right.

02:07.920 --> 02:14.890
Well let's let this run and see once it is deployed if it's all working. All right, our deployment's done.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.130
And look at that we have a new link.

02:17.270 --> 02:20.050
So let's run Heroku open

02:23.840 --> 02:31.570
All right, look at that we have a new link on our front end but let's see if it works if I sign in with

02:31.580 --> 02:35.970
Teddy at gmail dot com do one two three

02:38.680 --> 02:42.760
sign in.

02:42.850 --> 02:43.270
All right.

02:43.270 --> 02:46.780
And look at that. Teddy is loaded.

02:46.810 --> 02:52.050
He's already done a count before with the face. Let's do another one just to make sure it works.

02:54.650 --> 02:57.150
Click detect.

02:57.200 --> 03:04.450
No I don't want it to save Teddy's password but look at that everything is working.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.290
It seemed almost too easy right.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.210
So cool.

03:07.270 --> 03:17.790
Let's recap one more time what we just did. We've created three separate servers or three separate computers

03:18.360 --> 03:26.980
where each of these individual rectangles are running. We have a postgreSQL, a node server, and a front

03:26.980 --> 03:32.200
end and all of them are working exactly as they were on our computer.

03:32.200 --> 03:39.280
But this time in production. Live, into the world. And all we had to do, was just change some numbers to

03:39.280 --> 03:44.770
make sure that we're pointing these arrows so that the front end knows that this is where our server

03:44.770 --> 03:52.570
is and the server knows this is where our databases and these are just small configurations that is

03:52.570 --> 03:54.660
really dependent on each platform

03:54.700 --> 03:59.100
you work with, but the underlying concepts are the same.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.250
You're just pointing to the address to the location of these things.

04:02.550 --> 04:03.880
But oh boy.

04:04.650 --> 04:08.880
Well isn't that crazy how we've got all these things to work.

04:08.880 --> 04:16.370
I remember my first time in my career when I managed to connect the dots and actually build each one of these

04:16.740 --> 04:18.200
myself.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.430
It was an eye opener.

04:19.440 --> 04:26.100
It opened up a whole new world and it made me really understand how everything is connected and moving

04:26.100 --> 04:27.380
on from that point.

04:27.480 --> 04:38.100
I understood most things and every tool or new technology is just an addition to this pre-existing idea.

04:38.340 --> 04:45.990
And as long as you understand this underlying architecture, this underlying concept of different servers

04:45.990 --> 04:53.640
connecting to each other the rest is just extensions of this.

04:53.650 --> 04:56.170
So could we improve this app.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.130
Absolutely.

04:57.190 --> 04:59.800
You can do so many things with this app.

04:59.950 --> 05:07.570
We might want to be a little bit extra secure and perhaps not even have our API key in our code for

05:07.570 --> 05:09.760
our server.

05:09.850 --> 05:12.910
We can create something like environmental variables for this.

05:12.910 --> 05:23.590
For example on Heroku if we go to our smart brain app or let's go to our backend our radiant ocean now

05:23.590 --> 05:31.460
on here if we go to settings and go to reveal config VAR's we have our environmental variables here

05:32.030 --> 05:33.120
set for us.

05:33.170 --> 05:35.820
You remember postgres how we tried to connect to it.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.180
And we had a process dot env dot DATABASE_URL.

05:40.190 --> 05:46.770
Well we can add our own if we wanted to we can say API clarifai

05:51.420 --> 06:05.250
add the API key that we have in our backend into here click ADD and now we have this available to us

06:05.940 --> 06:18.900
as a process dot env dot API clarifai which is I believe what I call the and this is an extra layer of

06:18.900 --> 06:26.900
security you don't want anything sensitive like addresses or passwords or API keys in your codebase.

06:26.940 --> 06:28.650
So somebody can peek it.

06:28.800 --> 06:34.800
This is something that you'll get used to more and more and hopefully with what you know about environmental

06:34.800 --> 06:35.820
variables.

06:35.820 --> 06:36.920
This makes sense.

06:38.000 --> 06:47.120
But for now because this is a simple app we don't need to add any of this we'll revert the changes.

06:50.740 --> 06:59.820
And just be proud of ourselves for creating an awesome app and deploying it in real life.

07:01.790 --> 07:08.850
Now go share this link with all your friends and family and tell them how awesome of a dev you are. I'll see you

07:08.870 --> 07:10.380
in the next one.

07:10.440 --> 07:10.860
Bye-Bye.
