00:00.790 --> 00:02.510
Welcome back.

00:02.510 --> 00:03.280
All right.

00:03.410 --> 00:13.280
So the reason the image endpoint wasn't working was because of a silly silly error. I had left the port

00:13.370 --> 00:15.870
over here which shouldn't be here.

00:15.890 --> 00:23.000
As you can see our Heroku app is hosted there and we don't need the port.

00:23.120 --> 00:36.360
So if I saved this let's actually create a new user. We'll register Teddy this time and Teddy at G-mail dot

00:36.350 --> 00:43.790
com has a password of 1 2 3 we will register and let's grab another face

00:48.030 --> 00:49.440
grab this face this time

00:53.810 --> 00:55.820
we'll paste that in here.

00:55.820 --> 00:59.110
Detect and look at that.

00:59.110 --> 01:03.450
This is now updating and everything is working as intended.

01:06.040 --> 01:13.700
If we go back to our server we see that our image endpoint finally gets hit and everything is working.

01:13.810 --> 01:17.670
Amazingly How cool is that.

01:17.680 --> 01:26.860
We've just deployed a server and a database and they're both communicating together with the front end

01:26.860 --> 01:27.680
as well.

01:28.650 --> 01:34.900
So cool in the next video we're going to deploy our front end application on Heroku as well.

01:34.900 --> 01:39.670
So we have three different servers running for us.

01:39.670 --> 01:44.350
We could put it on Github pages but that's something that we've already done and I'm excited after

01:44.350 --> 01:47.160
doing these two so let's put this on Heroku as well.

01:47.230 --> 01:48.620
I'll see on that one.

01:48.720 --> 01:48.970
Bye-Bye.
