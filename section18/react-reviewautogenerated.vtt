Welcome back at the beginning of this re-act section I told you that things are going to get a little

00:07.050 --> 00:07.910
bit overwhelming.

00:07.950 --> 00:11.670
But at the end you're going to understand everything and things are going to make sense.

00:12.620 --> 00:15.700
I want to show you exactly how much you've learned.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.490
You've learned that components.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.830
Well now this makes sense right.

00:19.850 --> 00:26.090
You are building components during this section to combine things into containers and then finally have

00:26.090 --> 00:28.340
a page or an app.

00:28.420 --> 00:36.610
You also learn that there is one way data flow that is everything flows from state to props and you

00:36.610 --> 00:43.720
can have multiple children but the only people that can change state is a container component.

00:43.780 --> 00:50.290
In our case we only have one container component but you can have multiple and dat are just flows down

00:50.290 --> 00:57.790
one way and any time a child component changes they just trigger an event on the parent and he saw how

00:57.790 --> 01:04.110
awesome that was we didn't think about how we surrender things we were doing things deterministically.

01:04.120 --> 01:10.730
That is here's the state of the app render it accordingly and re-act took care of it for us.

01:10.740 --> 01:17.760
We also learned that well exactly what I said re-act worries about painting and making the website look

01:17.760 --> 01:18.260
good.

01:18.360 --> 01:23.760
We just give it the data and the components.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.850
We learned that re-act has an awesome ecosystem.

01:26.890 --> 01:33.880
We had great tools where we're able to start and build and it gave us great errors.

01:33.910 --> 01:37.200
So all these pain points that we had when we were first building our Web sites.

01:37.240 --> 01:37.990
Well they're gone.

01:37.990 --> 01:39.660
Everything is built for you.

01:39.790 --> 01:44.590
So there you're ready to just focus on coding without having to worry about configuration.

01:44.710 --> 01:50.130
When we get to our final project we're going to be using Riak components to build something really fast

01:50.260 --> 01:53.410
and just plug and play these components.

01:54.590 --> 01:58.940
And finally well this shouldn't look confusing to you anymore.

01:58.940 --> 02:00.060
This makes sense.

02:00.200 --> 02:08.120
This whole thing that looked intimidating at first will this is just react in this one image you have

02:08.480 --> 02:11.050
majority of why react is.

02:11.230 --> 02:18.520
And once you get used to the syntax it's an elegant solution to building beautiful web apps that are

02:18.520 --> 02:21.140
simple scalable and easy to manage.

02:23.400 --> 02:28.480
Good job getting this far in the course it takes a lot of dedication to get through this.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.700
BI You did it you're almost there.

02:32.270 --> 02:33.840
I'll see in the next one.

02:33.910 --> 02:34.130
Buh-Bye.
