WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:02.200
Welcome back.

00:02.430 --> 00:09.270
In this video we're going to talk a bit about something advanced and we haven't covered much in this

00:09.270 --> 00:15.030
course and we definitely will in the next section but I want to get started with it so that even though

00:15.030 --> 00:20.070
it might be new and confusing at first by the time we get into the next section we'll come back and

00:20.070 --> 00:22.020
review exactly what we're doing.

00:22.820 --> 00:27.880
I want to make this app more realistic in a real life app.

00:27.950 --> 00:34.380
We wouldn't necessarily have these robots written like a half here and robots start.

00:34.430 --> 00:35.010
Yes.

00:35.210 --> 00:36.370
I've just created this fall.

00:36.380 --> 00:42.120
But in real life well we're not manually entering users.

00:42.250 --> 00:46.610
We would use something like an API.

00:46.830 --> 00:48.050
And what that means.

00:48.060 --> 00:56.460
Well we want when this Web site gets loaded to make a request somewhere out there in the world or the

00:56.460 --> 01:06.710
internet and grab these robots from a server what we can actually do that we have over here something

01:06.710 --> 01:12.690
called Jason placeholder and you don't need to worry too much about it but they actually have a really

01:12.690 --> 01:21.030
nice your owl that we can use and they return what we need a name an ID and a user name.

01:21.060 --> 01:23.570
The rest of the information well we don't really need it.

01:23.580 --> 01:30.910
But as you can see just by typing in this you are well I get this.

01:30.910 --> 01:35.440
So using this we're going to make our app a little bit more realistic.

01:37.050 --> 01:37.910
Let's get started.

01:39.830 --> 01:45.900
If I close my CSSA file since we don't need them any more.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.260
And let's close the rest of the tabs as well.

01:49.920 --> 01:59.340
Looking at this app component we see that it is what we call a smart component like the search box or

01:59.420 --> 02:06.440
Carlist that are just pure functions as you can see here.

02:06.620 --> 02:15.200
Yes actually has state a piece of data that describes our app and because they have state we call them

02:15.200 --> 02:16.910
smart components.

02:17.820 --> 02:20.720
And smart components tend to have this class and.

02:21.300 --> 02:30.460
Now in real life when we start up this app this robots would actually be an empty array because there's

02:30.480 --> 02:31.160
nothing there.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.420
We haven't grabbed the users.

02:33.420 --> 02:42.710
So most likely if I save this robots wouldn't display until I load the Web site and then as soon as

02:42.710 --> 02:47.400
the Web site gets loaded I ask for the users from somewhere over the internet

02:50.020 --> 02:53.450
somewhere hopefully here.

02:53.490 --> 02:54.340
So let's do that.

02:56.610 --> 03:06.660
Re-act comes with a few other things inside of components that we can use and they're called life cycle

03:06.810 --> 03:07.450
methods.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.530
And it looks something like this.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.320
Don't get too overwhelmed.

03:15.400 --> 03:23.570
These are just methods that we can use in here that comes with re-act and they're called lifecycle hooks

03:23.570 --> 03:32.240
because what they do is if we run these it will automatically trigger when this app gets loaded on the

03:32.240 --> 03:32.960
Web site.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.700
Let me explain.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.490
We see that we have three sections.

03:37.670 --> 03:45.860
We have mounting updating and unmounting the way we act works is we do something called mounting.

03:45.940 --> 03:58.920
When I click refresh here the app component this component right here gets mounted into the document

03:59.820 --> 04:01.220
with the idea of route.

04:01.320 --> 04:09.180
If we go back to our index site a shemale file will our Web page is nothing but a div with an idea of

04:09.180 --> 04:09.960
root.

04:10.080 --> 04:21.350
When we say we mount a component we're replacing this and adding our entire app that's mounting So mounting

04:21.350 --> 04:31.480
is the start of the app now when mounting these are the lifecycle hooks that get hit and there are in-order.

04:31.510 --> 04:37.990
So the first thing is it checks Hey does this component have a constructor Bauld doesn't have a constructor.

04:37.990 --> 04:38.360
Yes.

04:38.390 --> 04:45.730
OK then run this piece of code does it have component will mount.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.840
No it doesn't then ignore it.

04:47.900 --> 04:53.240
Does it have Rander Yes it has wrencher run this.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.760
Does it have component did mount.

04:55.760 --> 05:01.910
No it doesn't have component mount ignore it and it just runs through this every time.

05:01.910 --> 05:08.200
It also has something called updating and that is whenever a component changes.

05:08.240 --> 05:18.160
For example when we had the list well every time I type something the card list component gets really

05:18.170 --> 05:24.090
rendered because we have new information the function receives new inputs.

05:24.090 --> 05:27.240
Same with the input component.

05:27.240 --> 05:36.020
So again within those components if we wanted to we can add component will receive prop's shook component

05:36.040 --> 05:38.600
update so on and so forth.

05:39.390 --> 05:50.010
And finally with unmounting is when a component is removed from a page for example if we change to a

05:50.040 --> 05:58.290
different page here the component will mount the app component will get deleted from the page.

05:58.290 --> 06:05.400
These are called lifecycle hooks because they get run every time a component does something and it comes

06:05.400 --> 06:06.720
with react.

06:06.720 --> 06:12.470
So you can just put them in into your class component and they'll automatically get triggered.

06:12.480 --> 06:16.310
You don't have to worry about calling the let me demonstrate this.

06:17.890 --> 06:24.280
We want to use component did mount which gets called after render this says that yes.

06:24.310 --> 06:31.190
The app component is mounted on the web page and it's aprender that is it's displaying something well

06:31.310 --> 06:43.840
we can do that by saying component did mount and because this is part of react.

06:43.890 --> 06:48.910
Notice that I'm not using aero functions here.

06:49.050 --> 06:50.570
Now we think component don't mount.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.240
I can say console default log

06:55.570 --> 07:05.240
if I refresh this and open up the console you'll see that I have check if I refresh.

07:05.240 --> 07:05.870
There you go.

07:05.870 --> 07:06.670
That was really quick.

07:06.680 --> 07:11.210
But you see that that gets called automatically even though I haven't said anything.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.030
Using this we can do something interesting.

07:15.110 --> 07:26.490
Now when component does mount I can say this dot set state to now have robots to the robots that we

07:26.490 --> 07:32.440
get from natural skiffle.

07:32.690 --> 07:38.730
If I do this and save let's refresh and see what happens.

07:40.070 --> 07:45.280
It's really really fast but you see that we're getting our robots.

07:45.280 --> 07:52.710
I am saying run the constructor with an empty array just to show you the order of execution here.

07:52.720 --> 07:57.190
If I had a console log and we'll just say one here

08:01.230 --> 08:08.090
will say two here and we'll just say three.

08:08.710 --> 08:24.150
If I save this and open up the console I have 1 3 2 3 let's just check that we have one Gerrans first

08:25.510 --> 08:35.250
then three which is render then two which is component did mount and then three runs again.

08:35.250 --> 08:43.390
Actually let's change this to actual words so that you see better what is actually happening.

08:46.120 --> 08:53.250
If we save and refresh look of that we have a constructor that runs first then render then component

08:53.250 --> 08:57.070
did mount just like this order.

08:57.220 --> 09:00.500
But we now also have render.

09:00.820 --> 09:03.840
Why did render run again.

09:03.890 --> 09:14.130
If you remember we created the constructor we ran Brandur and then we updated the state and component

09:14.130 --> 09:14.970
did MT.

09:15.060 --> 09:24.470
So because we updated the state every time the state changes Remember we go to the lifecycle it's updating

09:24.950 --> 09:26.150
Iran's render.

09:26.150 --> 09:37.210
Again so because it goes from an empty array to a robot's list render gets rerun and the virtual Dom

09:37.840 --> 09:47.240
notices that there's a difference and repaints our Web browser to include the robot's vertical knowing

09:47.240 --> 09:48.680
what we just did.

09:48.870 --> 09:56.050
We can remove this and finally make this more realistic.

09:56.050 --> 10:03.980
Instead of using the robot's file I'm actually going to remove this and in here I'm going to show you

10:04.850 --> 10:09.200
a cool way to grab this list from here.

10:09.200 --> 10:18.710
I'm going to copy the link and I'm going to say fetch which we'll learn about in the next section.

10:18.730 --> 10:25.680
We're just saying make this a sheet DP request and fetch receives this.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.570
Again we're just saying go through here then.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.800
This is going to receive a response

10:38.910 --> 10:43.320
and this response is Well this part is a little tricky.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.500
You just have to get used to it.

10:46.690 --> 10:53.560
Jason we just have to convert the response into again something that we'll talk about in the next session.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.990
For now just you can copy and paste this follow along.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.350
We'll come back to this and explain what's happening.

10:59.720 --> 11:05.220
And from here let's add this on a new line so we know exactly what's happening.

11:06.860 --> 11:14.660
We'll say then robots far we can say users because in this case we're getting users and in here we can

11:14.660 --> 11:15.080
say

11:18.440 --> 11:27.900
this says state robots to equal users and we have to make sure that we return this safe.

11:27.940 --> 11:29.000
Let's see if that works.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.040
Look at that.

11:31.140 --> 11:40.650
Let's refresh and you see that little lag it is now working.

11:40.730 --> 11:47.210
So in here we can actually make this smaller and reduce it to one line.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.810
We should remember how to do that.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.730
And we see that we're simply

11:55.440 --> 11:56.460
updating state

11:59.370 --> 12:01.910
after we fetch.

12:01.950 --> 12:04.780
So we fetch whatever the users are.

12:05.070 --> 12:06.750
We're getting a response.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.750
We're doing some magic here with Jaison which we'll talk about later.

12:10.890 --> 12:17.890
And then we're getting the users and updating the users with set state so far refresh.

12:17.890 --> 12:18.270
Again

12:21.040 --> 12:28.260
if I don't do this let's say I just here don't do anything and return an empty object.

12:28.390 --> 12:36.730
You see that I don't receive the robots I only receive the robots after I update with these users.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.060
How cool is that.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.030
All right.

12:43.030 --> 12:43.840
That was a lot.

12:43.870 --> 12:51.010
And this probably looks pretty scary to make you feel a little bit more comfortable because I'm using

12:51.010 --> 12:54.160
fetch and there is nothing attached to it.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.070
Does this mean that it's part of the window object.

12:58.300 --> 13:06.000
Let's check if I open up the console and I do window Daut fetch.

13:06.490 --> 13:07.210
Yeah look at that.

13:07.330 --> 13:12.190
Fetch is a method on the window object.

13:12.190 --> 13:14.160
It comes with all browsers now.

13:14.380 --> 13:17.120
It is a tool for us to make requests.

13:18.050 --> 13:26.480
Two servers and as you can see this is a server that returns for us when we do slash users a list of

13:26.480 --> 13:35.280
users that we can use which is perfect for our wrap.

13:35.320 --> 13:41.890
And finally you're wondering what if this was really slow or whatever this took I don't know five seconds

13:41.950 --> 13:44.460
and we had a whole ton of users.

13:44.860 --> 13:56.870
Well in that case you can do something like an IF statement if robots lenth is zero.

13:57.040 --> 14:03.510
In that case we can return an H1 that says loading

14:09.880 --> 14:13.090
else we can just say return

14:15.850 --> 14:19.360
this again is just javascript.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.800
That's a beauty in Riyadh.

14:22.490 --> 14:27.720
And you see how we get robots is not defined because it's this dot state DOT robots.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.910
Again we're referring to the State of the app.

14:30.350 --> 14:36.380
And here if I refresh let's just say that we're not updating the state and I'm going to just return

14:36.380 --> 14:37.310
an empty object

14:41.370 --> 14:48.610
while in that case I just get loading.

14:48.730 --> 14:50.240
Very cool.

14:50.290 --> 14:58.450
And this is how you build real ops with re-act you have a loading bar they can just add here make requests

14:58.450 --> 15:04.260
on component did mount and interact with components.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.110
Very cool.

15:07.950 --> 15:16.370
You know what we have ourselves our app there's one last thing I'm going to show you with react and

15:16.370 --> 15:18.860
you've learned the basics and react.

15:18.860 --> 15:22.180
You can take this now to build any app that you want.

15:22.340 --> 15:24.140
So one more thing to go.

15:24.170 --> 15:28.130
One more little piece to get our re-act knowledge completed.

15:28.550 --> 15:29.740
I'll see in the next one.

15:29.970 --> 15:30.180
Babai.
