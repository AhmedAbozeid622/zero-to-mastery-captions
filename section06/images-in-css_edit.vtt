00:00.740 --> 00:01.970
And welcome back.

00:01.970 --> 00:05.990
I want to show you a property that is commonly used with images.

00:06.140 --> 00:09.810
So I have a really funny picture here of an alpaca.

00:09.860 --> 00:11.000
So we're going to copy that.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.950
Actually we're going to use the link for this.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.870
And we're going to add an image to our website.

00:17.180 --> 00:20.290
Let's just make our font size a little bit smaller.

00:21.340 --> 00:21.870
Perfect.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.570
And I'm going to try and add a picture to the left over here.

00:25.570 --> 00:34.510
If we go to our About page and in our section over here we can try and add a picture so let's do

00:34.510 --> 00:35.620
an 'image' tag.

00:35.890 --> 00:41.160
And if you remember we have a source and that source I just copied and pasted the link.

00:41.200 --> 00:49.610
And if I save this and refresh - Ohhh! that's a big picture, so as your may remember you have to do width

00:51.290 --> 01:01.930
let's do 50 pixels and height 50 pixels. Let's save then refresh and you can see that we broke -

01:01.930 --> 01:04.180
Let's make that a little bit bigger actually.

01:04.360 --> 01:09.280
let's do 200px and 200px.

01:12.610 --> 01:13.580
Perfect.

01:13.600 --> 01:20.440
You can see here that we actually broke a bit of our CSS and that is because if you look over here

01:20.740 --> 01:26.160
we have used this selector which says immediate neighbor of 'h2'.

01:26.450 --> 01:28.450
We can just do this for now.

01:31.490 --> 01:32.210
refresh.

01:32.230 --> 01:34.070
And there you have it.

01:34.280 --> 01:38.480
But I kind of want the text to be on the right side over here.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.460
How do we do that.

01:39.680 --> 01:48.030
Well, we can select the image and use a property called float and float.

01:48.050 --> 01:50.800
You can do 'right' or 'left'.

01:50.810 --> 02:02.140
So if we do 'left' and refresh it floats the image to the left, and you see that the text wraps around and

02:02.140 --> 02:08.530
this property was created specifically for these reasons - to have images floating to either left or right

02:08.590 --> 02:12.020
and be able to have text wrapped around them.

02:13.170 --> 02:19.800
You'll see instances were float is being used for positioning elements and that's not the best practice

02:19.800 --> 02:22.060
because it has some funny properties.

02:22.110 --> 02:25.420
For now just use it with images if you can.

02:26.320 --> 02:31.830
And one thing to note with 'float' - and just to show you that I can do it on the right as well.

02:31.960 --> 02:38.410
I go like this and refresh it floats to the right, I kind of like this better will keep that there.

02:38.410 --> 02:42.430
The other thing I want to show you is that if we added anything,

02:42.670 --> 02:56.520
so after the image we want to have a footer and this 'footer' it'll say "Website Made With Love" close that

02:56.800 --> 02:57.640
And save.

02:57.700 --> 03:04.110
And we also want to make this actually a lot smaller so I'm going to do five pixels because I want to

03:04.110 --> 03:05.020
show you something.

03:05.800 --> 03:12.730
So you see over here I've made this line had very very small but I wanted to demonstrate for you because

03:12.940 --> 03:14.110
this is floated to the right.

03:14.110 --> 03:17.430
Everything just kind of tacks on to the left side over here.

03:17.650 --> 03:24.340
And if we wanted to make sure that our footer is at the bottom of the Web site we would have to use

03:24.340 --> 03:32.140
a property that always almost always comes with float and it's usually put in the property after the

03:32.140 --> 03:33.100
float is being used.

03:33.110 --> 03:38.890
So in our case footer and we have to specify clear both.

03:38.920 --> 03:48.850
So if I save and refresh we have that at the bottom let's align it to the center here and refresh - oops! I didn't... 

03:48.900 --> 03:54.670
and let's do 'center' save and refresh.

03:54.670 --> 03:56.040
Perfect.

03:56.080 --> 04:01.310
Now we have "Website Made With Love" with a whole bunch of gibberish.

04:01.420 --> 04:08.620
But I wanted to show you that property 'float' for images and make sure that we 'clear' so it can start

04:08.620 --> 04:15.190
on the website on its own past the image. See you in the next one. Bye-bye
