WEBVTT

00:01.070 --> 00:06.170
And a Welcome Back in this video we're going to talk all about selectors.

00:06.230 --> 00:08.200
Let's go back to our home page here.

00:08.270 --> 00:10.870
We can look at our styles.

00:10.970 --> 00:19.470
So far we've only been selecting elements but most likely we need something more than this.

00:19.490 --> 00:25.010
So let's go back to our example and look at what sort of selectors we can have.

00:25.190 --> 00:33.050
Let's say for example that we want the style that we have for the big 'Home' header to also apply to our

00:33.320 --> 00:34.280
'p' tag.

00:34.580 --> 00:35.650
How can we do that.

00:35.720 --> 00:44.320
Well we can do something like this, I save, refresh awesome.

00:44.490 --> 00:50.910
So that's a way of doing a selector and there's actually a whole bunch of things that we can do with

00:50.910 --> 00:57.090
selectors and I create for you a nice little cheat sheet here that I'll attach after this lesson and

00:57.330 --> 01:01.600
it references two really two good resources that I recommend.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.030
One is the CSS Tricks that I've already mentioned.

01:05.100 --> 01:12.330
And you can see over here, all the selectors that they have there not as many as they had with properties

01:12.510 --> 01:16.410
and it's actually not as overwhelming as you think.

01:16.530 --> 01:22.620
Probably about 30 percent of these are the ones that are used most of the time and we also have our

01:22.680 --> 01:28.570
good friend W3 Schools that lists a bunch of the selectors here.

01:28.740 --> 01:35.490
So let's go over a few things and understand the main selectors that we have so I've listed them off for you

01:35.490 --> 01:36.310
over here.

01:36.510 --> 01:42.680
But I want to point your attention to this line: "Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level

01:42.750 --> 01:46.870
ut indicates" - there you go, typo (typing error) -

01:46.900 --> 01:52.630
"...it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter." And that's something that we've already discussed before

01:52.630 --> 01:54.980
you remember the 'p' tags.

01:55.150 --> 02:02.890
So the order matters because we know that the CSS will read the last line and make sure that the color is green.

02:02.950 --> 02:10.130
So that's the most basic level but there is a few other things that we can do.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.580
So let's look at the selectors.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.210
The first one is 'class'.

02:13.250 --> 02:16.650
The 'class' will do something like this.

02:16.650 --> 02:20.510
Let's say we want to add a few more 'p' tags here.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.900
And refresh.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.600
Okay perfect.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.540
We love the way everything looks.

02:27.600 --> 02:33.970
But ideally for the paragraphs we want the border to be a slightly different color.

02:34.050 --> 02:43.140
So what we can do is we can add something called 'class' so the class property - we can give it any value

02:43.140 --> 02:46.680
we want, whatever we want to call it - let's call it "webtext".

02:46.680 --> 02:55.530
Now we can copy and paste this class attribute to all the 'p' tags.

02:55.710 --> 03:06.230
And if I go back to my style let's make this, put it up a bit I can now add '.webtext' (period webtext) and then

03:06.230 --> 03:14.870
from here you can see that it's highlighted green and we want the border to be '5px dashed green' 

03:15.720 --> 03:20.740
save and refresh, and look at that.

03:20.750 --> 03:29.120
So 'class' is a good way to select a group of elements and make sure that they all have the same styles

03:29.390 --> 03:33.440
and we can add multiple ones, so this one can be 'active'.

03:33.800 --> 03:44.150
And this adds a second class which we can say has the text 'color: red'.

03:44.480 --> 03:54.060
So if we save that, save this as well and refresh you can see over here that now this is red. So 'class' is

03:54.060 --> 03:55.340
very very useful.

03:55.380 --> 03:56.570
Let's look at the next one.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.570
Drag this over here.

03:59.770 --> 04:00.170
OK.

04:00.410 --> 04:09.780
The next one is 'id', 'id' is similar to class except for you can use the same 'id' only once.

04:09.800 --> 04:18.050
So let's say that we want to group these 'p' tags by wrapping them in a 'div' and you might remember this

04:18.050 --> 04:24.980
from the HTML section where we talked about this tag that is very very useful for CSS for occasions

04:24.980 --> 04:30.420
like this where we want to wrap something so I can do ' id="div1" '.

04:30.470 --> 04:39.150
And if I save this,crr I can now go back here and for an 'id' you want to do a hash ('#') sign '#div1' and let's do

04:39.190 --> 04:49.040
 'background: blue' save and refresh alright that looks absolutely hideous.

04:49.060 --> 04:49.540
You know what.

04:49.540 --> 04:54.010
I think this will look really really good if it was - if it had a bit of opacity.

04:54.010 --> 05:02.750
So again we remember 'rgba' and if we want it blue if you remember is red green and blue.

05:02.850 --> 05:07.120
'255' and then we'll add opacity of let's say 0.2.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.700
We save that refresh.

05:09.880 --> 05:10.160
All right.

05:10.170 --> 05:11.850
And that looks a lot better.

05:11.980 --> 05:18.930
But now let's say we copy this and we want to add a second section.

05:18.970 --> 05:22.800
Now we would have to call this 'div2'

05:22.810 --> 05:26.220
Again we want to make sure that the 'id's are different.

05:26.260 --> 05:27.730
Otherwise we break the rules.

05:27.730 --> 05:36.770
Now if I save this to have something new but no styles in this one we want to add a different style for

05:36.800 --> 05:37.520
'div2'.

05:37.520 --> 05:47.390
So again this selector of 'div2' will have let's say this one instead of 'blue' has the background 'red'

05:47.390 --> 05:49.270
with opacity of '0.2'(point 2).

05:49.460 --> 05:52.200
Let's refresh and look at that.

05:52.510 --> 05:54.480
that's look - I'll say a lot better than it used to.

05:54.640 --> 05:59.630
OK let's go back to a couple of other ones so this is a '*'(star).

05:59.930 --> 06:06.440
So the star [*] - it's not used very often but it symbolizes all elements.

06:06.440 --> 06:12.650
So if I do - and usually you'll see stars at the top but if I do something like this, I can say that we

06:12.660 --> 06:21.080
wanted to align everything and say 'text-align' and we want to do 'right' I save that and refresh.

06:21.080 --> 06:27.570
Now we see that this moved to the right but these didn't.

06:27.760 --> 06:31.870
And the reason is because again something called specificity.

06:32.050 --> 06:35.340
We're saying that yep I want everything to be 'right'.

06:35.440 --> 06:43.190
But then as we go down the CSS you'll see that we are saying 'h2' and 'p' - We want 'text-align' to be 'center'.

06:43.300 --> 06:47.950
So these elements instead of coming to the right get to the center.

06:47.980 --> 06:53.510
So just to prove to you that that's correct if I comment this out I save and refresh.

06:53.740 --> 06:56.490
You see everything moves to the right.

06:56.500 --> 06:56.940
OK.

06:57.130 --> 06:58.320
And let's refresh.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.390
Perfect.

06:59.590 --> 07:02.960
The next one is the element and this (is) something that we've already seen.

07:03.040 --> 07:09.420
You can see over here we're selecting the element and then we're putting the property and values. The next

07:09.420 --> 07:15.170
one is the 'element, element' and that is just like we've done here before.

07:15.240 --> 07:19.740
We want both 'h2' and 'p' to have these properties.

07:19.740 --> 07:28.020
The next one and this is a little bit tricky is 'element element' (element space element) and this is a little bit different

07:28.020 --> 07:33.830
than the top on because 'element element' (element space element) what it does.

07:33.850 --> 07:34.660
I'll show you over here.

07:34.660 --> 07:37.700
I save this and I refresh.

07:37.910 --> 07:40.780
And hmm.. what just happened here.

07:40.890 --> 07:48.940
You'll see that now the 'text-align: center' does not apply to these paragraphs anymore and that's because

07:49.570 --> 07:57.630
this syntax of writing a selector means I want you to select all 'p's that are inside 'h2'.

07:57.670 --> 08:04.810
So now even the 'h2' isn't styled anymore because this says you only want the 'p's that are inside 'h2'

08:05.170 --> 08:09.970
and you'll see that we have nothing inside 'h2' other than the text.

08:09.970 --> 08:15.910
So if I do something like this home, home - 'homegnome' like that.

08:15.990 --> 08:19.960
OK perfect I save that and I refresh.

08:20.410 --> 08:24.390
You'll see that 'homegnome' is added,

08:25.350 --> 08:32.210
with these styles. Let's look at the next on the next one is 'element > element' (element greater than element).

08:32.280 --> 08:34.910
So this one is a little tricky.

08:35.250 --> 08:44.160
So if I go like this and I refresh, nothing's changed but this says that I want to select all 'p's - all

08:44.160 --> 08:51.400
paragraphs that have a parent of 'h2'. So, to show you exactly what that means.

08:51.430 --> 08:57.410
 -let's add this on a new line so you can see better. If now, within this 'p'.

08:57.470 --> 09:07.970
If we do something like this where we wrap this in a 'div' like so and I refresh this, the style didn't

09:07.970 --> 09:12.720
get applied because it only wants 'p's.

09:12.830 --> 09:21.220
So paragraphs that are *parents (*Children) of 'h2' and this 'p' is a - his parent or her parent is the 'div'.

09:21.440 --> 09:30.890
Mr. and Mrs. 'div'. If we put this back to the way it was and refresh you'll see that this time it works

09:30.890 --> 09:35.890
because it's saying all 'p's inside of 'h2', which is the case.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.410
Hopefully you're still with me.

09:37.430 --> 09:40.150
This is as hard as selectors get.

09:40.160 --> 09:47.320
So once you know these ones, honestly you've covered 90 percent and nothing else will scare you. OK.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.290
Let's look at one more 'element + element' (element plus element).

09:51.290 --> 10:00.080
So this one if I go 'element + element' and refresh, hmm.. what just happened this says select any 'p' element

10:00.140 --> 10:03.530
that is exactly after an 'h2' element.

10:03.530 --> 10:04.620
So what does that mean?

10:04.760 --> 10:15.910
Well we need to make it so that the 'p' element is right after the 'h2'.

10:15.960 --> 10:23.510
So if I go like this, save and refresh you'll see that now we have our styles applied.

10:23.640 --> 10:29.760
Let's look at a few more and like I said the these ones are probably the hardest these last ones are kind

10:29.760 --> 10:30.390
of fun.

10:30.690 --> 10:31.100
OK.

10:31.350 --> 10:34.190
So we have 'hover' so hover,

10:34.590 --> 10:42.850
what that means is if I go over here and I put 'hover' at the end this means that when I refresh.

10:42.890 --> 10:51.420
nothing happens but when I hover my mouse look at that, it changes the style to what we just wrote down over

10:51.420 --> 10:51.980
here.

10:52.010 --> 10:55.800
This one, a pretty cool one especially for buttons the next one.

10:55.800 --> 11:01.050
If we look over here is 'last-child' and 'first-child' and you might guess what that means.

11:01.050 --> 11:05.870
So good way to demonstrate this is we wanna (want to) use 'webtext'.

11:05.940 --> 11:10.590
So 'webtext' and if you remember is all these little 'Loremipsums'.

11:10.710 --> 11:21.760
I can say in here 'last-child' refresh and only the last child of each 'webtext' and you'll see here

11:21.760 --> 11:29.260
that there's two of them because it is selecting the last-child, this one and this one.

11:29.370 --> 11:37.560
And then there's also a 'first-child' which as you can imagine if I refresh it selects the first item. And then

11:37.560 --> 11:43.410
finally I want to show you one last thing that I don't recommend but you might see it in some code bases

11:43.410 --> 11:46.510
so I don't want you to be surprised when you come across it.

11:47.390 --> 11:48.830
And that is this:

11:48.920 --> 11:55.670
So I can add something like '!important' (exclamation mark important) here, and you'll see again we you get that nice

11:55.670 --> 11:59.570
highlighting. And important means - let's see what happens here.

12:00.390 --> 12:03.430
I refresh everything just turn pink.

12:03.430 --> 12:08.020
Even though this 'p' over here says I want the color green.

12:08.050 --> 12:15.170
'!important' overrides any of the cascading stylesheet rules and says, "hey I don't care what anybody else says.

12:15.250 --> 12:21.700
The 'p' is pink." and you can see here why I don't recommend using this, because although you know for sure

12:21.700 --> 12:28.990
that the p-tags will be pink if somebody else comes and starts working on your stylesheet - and maybe this

12:28.990 --> 12:33.580
is hundreds of lines and they don't know that the important tag is there.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.850
They can be confused as to hey how come nothing's turning green.

12:36.850 --> 12:41.080
I can play all round with the color here and nothing's happening.

12:41.140 --> 12:44.490
And again it breaks the rules of cascading stylesheets.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.330
So you don't really want to use it.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.880
But again if you see it out in the wild you won't be surprised this way.

12:49.900 --> 12:55.130
The last thing I want to leave you with is the idea of specificity.

12:55.180 --> 13:01.030
If this is your first time running into it, it might get a little confusing and you do need a bit of

13:01.030 --> 13:02.280
time to get used to it.

13:02.440 --> 13:08.680
But trust me you'll get there it's just one of these things that everybody goes through and eventually

13:08.800 --> 13:10.530
you'll have an 'Aha!' moment.

13:10.620 --> 13:15.720
When the selectors win out in the cascade it depends on three things.

13:15.760 --> 13:23.260
So the first thing is specificity and I have a resource here that really explains it well. A simple way

13:23.260 --> 13:28.510
to think about this is how specific is your selector.

13:28.510 --> 13:33.510
So this has the specificity score of here.

13:33.790 --> 13:37.680
This has a little bit higher because it's more detailed.

13:37.690 --> 13:39.120
It's more nested.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.380
And this one is higher.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.760
This one is even higher.

13:43.930 --> 13:51.040
And you can see that it keeps going higher and higher so the more specific something is the more likely

13:51.040 --> 13:54.380
it will win out and make sure that that is the style.

13:54.580 --> 13:59.070
And there's actually a really fun specificity calculator -

13:59.080 --> 14:00.720
It's really hard to say that word -

14:01.210 --> 14:10.600
So if you click over here you can type in whatever you want so let's say  'a' for example is just one point.

14:10.600 --> 14:17.230
But if I do 'li', that's two and if I do 'li' that's even higher.

14:17.260 --> 14:23.200
And if I do 'a' even higher but then I add an 'id' of '#food'.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.570
You see that 'id's are even higher.

14:25.570 --> 14:33.580
And then if I add another class let's do '.blue', you'll see that the specificity increases and you'll see

14:33.580 --> 14:37.000
over here that inline styles is actually the highest.

14:37.000 --> 14:46.580
So if you remember, that is putting a style directly into a section, that will always win out over others.

14:46.600 --> 14:53.740
So you can play around with this and I will link to some of the resources that I have in the next section.

14:53.860 --> 14:59.510
But again this is something that will be very specific once you get to a certain problem.

14:59.530 --> 15:02.460
You can figure it out but I hope that makes sense.

15:02.470 --> 15:04.930
Let's go back over here to the last two things.

15:04.960 --> 15:12.270
So the other thing was the importance - importance is as I mentioned this 'exclamation mark important' (!important).

15:12.460 --> 15:16.800
So that always depends on what kind of styles the cascade gets.

15:16.990 --> 15:25.090
And then finally it is the source order and that is - let's go back to our index file.

15:25.090 --> 15:30.850
If we had another stylesheet here, let's say we're importing another style sheet.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.240
And if you remember we have 'style2' here that makes the 'h2' color blue.

15:36.310 --> 15:46.730
If I put this in, save, let's go back to our website and refresh, this turns blue because our browser

15:46.940 --> 15:50.370
reads this stylesheet and then reads this one.

15:50.370 --> 15:54.230
And because this one happens after this the later style gets added.

15:54.230 --> 16:02.800
So if I switch this over here and I save, refresh and let's make sure that the 'h2' has its own style

16:02.830 --> 16:11.550
so let's do 'h2' 'color: red', refresh you'll see that this style wins out.

16:11.890 --> 16:12.290
OK.

16:12.370 --> 16:18.520
I'm going to leave this out for you in the next section you can play around with CSS and some of the

16:18.520 --> 16:21.630
selectors but this is the hardest

16:21.670 --> 16:22.520
it's going to get.

16:22.540 --> 16:26.290
And once you remember these rules you're all set.

16:26.290 --> 16:27.920
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
