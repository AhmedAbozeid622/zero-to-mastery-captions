00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.949
And we got another Q&amp;A video for you and this one
is going to be talking about something that you may

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.629
have seen yourself while following along these
videos and that is the fact that this file over here

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.110
is different than let's say if you go to a Web
site and you see 'https'- what does that mean?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.870
If you go into our example you also saw here that we
have an anchor tag that references a 'newpage.html'

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.670
that has nothing like 'file'
or 'http' in front of it.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.410
And then you also saw that the images here are referencing
some sort of a website that links to a picture.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.899
So what's the difference here? The difference here is
that the first is using the file protocol and that

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.140
means that this web-page -

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.830
I can't really access it
outside of my computer.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.039
This is using something
called a relative path.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:15.059
If I go into my 'index.html' I am saying
to link to 'newpage.html' relative to where

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.979
'index.html' is.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.590
So if we go to our desktop
you see that 'index.html'

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.730
lives in the same directory,
which is the desktop, as 'newpage.html'.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.990
So I can reference it through here. If I created a new
folder or let's say, "test" I would have to reference

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
it this way.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.620
So let's let's check here.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.900
If I save this and go into the web-page refresh and
click "New Page" I'll get "Your file was not found."

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:59.830
But now if I go into my desktop and create "test"
and I put the new page in here and let's bring back

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.670
everything refresh and click on new page,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.800
this is now working.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.230
And you can see over here that I'm accessing
it through "Desktop/test/newpage.html".

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.039
So that's called a relative path.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.370
So relative to where 'index.html'
page is I am saying, " 'index.html',

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.440
I want to access from
'test/newpage.html' ".

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.269
If you look at the images you'll see
that we have something different.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.689
We're accessing the image through http, which
we'll get into into later videos when we talk about

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.460
servers but this is how we
access files over the internet.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.800
If I wanted this anchor tag, this 'New Page' to actually
link to something, maybe another website, maybe

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:56.810
to this hilarious gif. Well I can copy this link,
open up my Sublime Text, and now I can just copy this

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.600
with the https protocol.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.790
And now this is an absolute link.
No matter where I reference this -

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:15.409
if I put it into 'newpage.html', or 'index.html',
no matter what, this link will get me to this

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.760
gif.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.819
So let's test that out:

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.220
I save this, I refresh, and I click
on 'New Page', and look at that.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.960
We have the gif.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.730
Hopefully that answers your question.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.139
We'll get into http,
and https later on in the course.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:41.259
But for now keep that in mind, that there is absolute
path and then there is relative path - going to fix that,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.140
so we have it back for the next video.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.610
I'll see on the next one.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.090
Bye-bye
