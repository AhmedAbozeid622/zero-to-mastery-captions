00:01.590 --> 00:08.010
And we got another Q&amp;A video for you and this one is going to be talking about something that you may

00:08.010 --> 00:15.690
have seen yourself while following along these videos and that is the fact that this file over here

00:15.690 --> 00:22.170
is different than let's say if you go to a Web site and you see 'https'- what does that mean?

00:22.380 --> 00:30.930
If you go into our example you also saw here that we have an anchor tag that references a 'newpage.html'

00:30.960 --> 00:38.030
 that has nothing like 'file' or 'http' in front of it.

00:38.160 --> 00:45.800
And then you also saw that the images here are referencing some sort of a website that links to a picture.

00:45.840 --> 00:55.690
So what's the difference here? The difference here is that the first is using the file protocol and that

00:55.690 --> 00:57.930
means that this web-page -

00:58.050 --> 01:01.620
I can't really access it outside of my computer.

01:01.650 --> 01:07.070
This is using something called a relative path.

01:07.170 --> 01:17.190
If I go into my 'index.html' I am saying to link to 'newpage.html' relative to where

01:17.190 --> 01:19.110
'index.html' is.

01:19.110 --> 01:22.720
So if we go to our desktop you see that 'index.html'

01:22.770 --> 01:27.860
lives in the same directory, which is the desktop, as 'newpage.html'.

01:28.050 --> 01:38.620
So I can reference it through here. If I created a new folder or let's say, "test" I would have to reference

01:38.620 --> 01:39.720
it this way.

01:39.730 --> 01:41.270
So let's let's check here.

01:41.290 --> 01:50.490
If I save this and go into the web-page refresh and click "New Page" I'll get "Your file was not found."

01:51.350 --> 02:02.420
But now if I go into my desktop and create "test" and I put the new page in here and let's bring back

02:03.500 --> 02:07.260
everything refresh and click on new page,

02:07.340 --> 02:08.390
this is now working.

02:08.540 --> 02:13.820
And you can see over here that I'm accessing it through "Desktop/test/newpage.html".

02:13.850 --> 02:15.630
So that's called a relative path.

02:15.630 --> 02:21.960
So relative to where 'index.html' page is I am saying, " 'index.html',

02:21.980 --> 02:26.030
I want to access from 'test/newpage.html' ".

02:26.150 --> 02:30.860
If you look at the images you'll see that we have something different.

02:30.860 --> 02:37.280
We're actually seeing the image through http, which we'll get into into later videos when we talk about

02:37.280 --> 02:42.370
servers but this is how we access files over the internet.

02:42.440 --> 02:48.770
If I wanted this anchor tag, this 'New Page' to actually link to something, maybe another website, maybe

02:49.400 --> 02:59.780
to this hilarious gif. Well I can copy this link, open up my Sublime Text, and now I can just copy this

03:00.290 --> 03:03.570
with the https protocol.

03:04.280 --> 03:09.760
And now this is an absolute link. No matter where I reference this -

03:09.860 --> 03:18.380
if I put it into 'newpage.html', or 'index.html', no matter what, this link will get me to this

03:18.380 --> 03:18.730
gif.

03:18.770 --> 03:19.790
So let's test that out:

03:19.790 --> 03:25.190
I save this, I refresh, and I click on 'New Page', and look at that.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.930
We have the gif.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.700
Hopefully that answers your question.

03:30.710 --> 03:35.110
We'll get into http, and https later on in the course.

03:35.110 --> 03:44.230
But for now keep that in mind, that there is absolute path and then there is relative path - going to fix that,

03:44.230 --> 03:47.110
so we have it back for the next video.

03:47.470 --> 03:48.580
I'll see on the next one.

03:48.650 --> 03:49.060
Bye-bye
