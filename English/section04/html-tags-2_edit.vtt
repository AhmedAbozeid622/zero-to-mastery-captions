00:00.850 --> 00:07.620
And welcome back. In the previous video we talked about a few of the common tags that HTML uses.

00:07.630 --> 00:12.790
We're going to expand on that knowledge and learn a few more. So, I'm going to delete these, and I'm going

00:12.790 --> 00:17.360
to teach you about something called an 'Ordered List'.

00:17.410 --> 00:24.110
So an 'ol' tag, and within this tag we have list 'li' items -

00:27.140 --> 00:39.800
'banana' and, another list item, 'apple', and lastly let's do, 'orange'.

00:39.810 --> 00:48.200
So if I save this, again, I refresh and we have banana, apple, orange. So you can see here this is how you

00:48.200 --> 00:49.370
make lists.

00:49.640 --> 00:53.480
And this is an 'Ordered List' so you can see we have '1, 2, 3'.

00:53.780 --> 00:59.350
If we want to make it without the numbers, we use something called an 'Unordered List', 'ul'.

00:59.390 --> 01:03.420
And again I save that, and refresh, and we have these.

01:03.450 --> 01:06.470
Now there's also subfields that you can use.

01:06.470 --> 01:10.750
So again this is all about nesting, and having parent tags, and children tags.

01:10.880 --> 01:18.080
So let's say within 'apples' we wanted to have - let me structure that are a little bit cleaner,

01:19.640 --> 01:22.010
there you go, within 'apples'.

01:22.010 --> 01:30.160
We also want to emphasize that there is the 'fuji' apple and there is 'honey crisp'.

01:30.290 --> 01:38.170
And while I can't think of a third type of apple, so, I'm going to delete that. If I save this, and refresh,

01:38.330 --> 01:44.540
well, we have a nested list. There you have it you have your list items. I'll see in the next video, where

01:44.540 --> 01:49.760
we're going to learn about putting images into our website and self-closing tags.

01:49.800 --> 01:50.510
See you in the next one.
