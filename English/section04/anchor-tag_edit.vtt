00:00.920 --> 00:06.800
And welcome back! In the previous videos we talked about some of the most common a HTML tags

00:06.800 --> 00:11.530
and how the HTML document is read by the browser.

00:11.570 --> 00:20.450
However we've missed one critical feature of HTML, and if we go back to our diagram here, that we

00:20.450 --> 00:29.810
should remember from the first section the HTML file gets sent to us but the power of HTML is

00:29.810 --> 00:32.690
in its ability to link to other document.

00:32.690 --> 00:43.400
So if I go back here to our website it's a simple one page web site but I can't really click on 'fuji',

00:43.400 --> 00:44.900
or 'apple', or 'banana'.

00:45.110 --> 00:47.210
It doesn't link to anything.

00:47.210 --> 00:50.770
There must be a HTML tag that we can use for that right?

00:51.020 --> 00:53.520
Well yes there is.

00:53.810 --> 00:56.440
It's called a anchor tag.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.280
So an anchor tag is very easy just an 'a'.

00:59.750 --> 01:09.390
And this anchor tag has something called an 'href' which is an attribute and it's the hypertext reference.

01:09.410 --> 01:14.450
So in this 'href' you'll be able to link to something.

01:14.570 --> 01:15.640
Let's close this 'a' tag.

01:15.650 --> 01:18.840
An 'a' tag has an opening and closing tag.

01:19.340 --> 01:26.990
And if I save this and refresh the page, well nothing happens because you need something in the anchor

01:26.990 --> 01:27.450
tag.

01:27.710 --> 01:30.690
So let's do "New Page".

01:30.920 --> 01:32.990
I save that, I refresh.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.060
And we have "New Page" here.

01:35.090 --> 01:43.750
Now if I click this, nothing happens. But you can see that it has the link, and the mouse changes images,

01:43.820 --> 01:46.610
so it's clickable but nothing happens.

01:46.610 --> 01:51.860
Well that's because we need to specify where we want the link to go.

01:51.860 --> 01:55.960
Now let's think about this if we want to link to a new page.

01:55.970 --> 02:00.500
We don't really have another new page, if you remember in our desktop over here.

02:00.530 --> 02:03.040
Let me close some of these.

02:03.050 --> 02:05.110
We only have 'index.html'.

02:06.020 --> 02:09.330
Wouldn't it be great if there was another file that we can link to?

02:09.420 --> 02:12.420
Well let's create another file.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.950
So let's open up Sublime Text,

02:14.960 --> 02:25.940
actually. I'm going to say 'File' 'New File', I'm going to save this as 'index2' - actually just name it

02:25.940 --> 02:26.450
'newpage'.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.840
And we're going to save it to desktop and see over here how,

02:30.930 --> 02:33.470
when I went to Sublime Text,

02:33.470 --> 02:35.780
It's now a 'Plain Text'?

02:35.970 --> 02:43.430
I need to make sure that this is an HTML file, so I can just do 'newpage.html'. Save, and Sublime Text

02:43.520 --> 02:45.920
automatically adjusts to the 'HTML'.

02:45.920 --> 02:55.070
So again I can type in that short command, 'html' and (then press) 'Tab', that comes with Sublime Text, and let's do

02:55.190 --> 02:58.490
the title 'New Page' and the 'body'

02:58.610 --> 03:06.490
We can just do a header [h1] that says, "This is the new page!"

03:06.580 --> 03:13.230
If I save this... great! we have a new page. And if I go to my desktop here, you see that I have 'newpage.html'

03:13.320 --> 03:15.140
and 'index.html'.

03:15.150 --> 03:18.210
So how do we link these two together?

03:18.220 --> 03:20.070
Well it's very simple.

03:20.070 --> 03:24.320
We open up sublime again and within 'index.html'.

03:24.510 --> 03:34.710
The 'href' can now say we're linking to 'newpage.html'. Let's save that and let's give it a try.

03:35.100 --> 03:38.260
Refresh the page, click,

03:38.400 --> 03:40.960
And "This is a new page!" awesome.

03:40.970 --> 03:48.520
But to go back we have to press the back symbol, so let's link back to the original file again.

03:48.770 --> 03:59.000
We can do this by, let's do a 'p', tag which is for 'paragraph' - I'm going to say 'Go Back'. Close that tag [/p].

03:59.110 --> 04:00.440
But, hold on a minute.

04:00.460 --> 04:02.570
I need an anchor tag, right?

04:02.590 --> 04:06.810
If I just save this, and refresh the page, I say, 'Go Back'.

04:06.810 --> 04:14.880
But what if you really, really want this to be a paragraph, or let's say you want this to be an 'h2' but

04:14.910 --> 04:17.980
you also want it to be an anchor tag.

04:18.060 --> 04:22.310
Well that's very simple you just wrap it in an anchor tag [a].

04:22.740 --> 04:27.120
And just so it's nice and clear, we're going to have the nice spacing here.

04:27.270 --> 04:33.280
And again an anchor tag must have an 'href', which tells us where to go. And we want to go to 'index.html'

04:33.590 --> 04:40.100
So, 'index.html', save, and refresh.

04:40.510 --> 04:41.440
Let's go back.

04:42.430 --> 04:44.750
Let's go to the next one, and back.

04:44.950 --> 04:50.490
So this is the power that comes with HTML, this ability to link to other pages.

04:50.620 --> 04:57.610
And yeah, we can have text, we can have lists, we can have images, but the true power is in this linking

04:57.610 --> 05:01.680
ability. In the next episode we're going to expand on this.

05:01.930 --> 05:03.280
I'll see you in that one. Bye-bye
