00:01.040 --> 00:01.700
Welcome back.

00:01.700 --> 00:08.180
In this video we're going to expand on our knowledge and introduce you to a few more HTML tags and

00:08.180 --> 00:11.260
make this website look a little bit prettier than just, "Hellooooooooo there."

00:12.230 --> 00:16.100
To get started I'm just going to move the screens around so you can see better.

00:18.490 --> 00:18.960
All right.

00:19.060 --> 00:25.350
So we have left, and right, and again just to make sure everything works.

00:25.420 --> 00:35.610
If I change anything here to, - and then I click 'Save', and then I refresh the page, I have everything

00:35.610 --> 00:38.260
updating perfect. Now,

00:38.730 --> 00:42.510
these aren't the only HTML tags that you'll encounter.

00:42.510 --> 00:52.050
There is actually a ton of them, and if you go back to the 'w3schools.com' you'll see over here all

00:52.050 --> 00:55.700
the HTML tags that exist.

00:57.460 --> 00:58.910
There's a lot of them.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.650
We're only going to be going through,

01:01.740 --> 01:09.220
I would say maybe, 10 or 15 or so because those are the only ones that, well technically, that I've used

01:09.220 --> 01:13.900
in many years of devolvement - there's a few things on here that I've never even heard of.

01:13.900 --> 01:14.950
I've never used.

01:14.970 --> 01:17.990
You can always look up and learn them yourself.

01:18.100 --> 01:23.200
But I'll say that there's about 10 or 15 tags that are used,

01:23.200 --> 01:26.110
ninety-nine percent of the time and those are the ones that you'll encounter.

01:26.110 --> 01:32.010
So we'll go through some of those most popular ones and HTMTL doesn't really get any harder than -

01:32.300 --> 01:33.220
than this.

01:33.220 --> 01:40.960
This is the syntax, as long as you get used to these little signs and structure you're pretty much a

01:41.330 --> 01:43.350
HTML developer.

01:43.380 --> 01:48.430
So the first tag that I want to introduce you to is the 'h1' tag.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.810
So the way that I have it here is actually not right.

01:52.830 --> 01:59.460
You want to make sure that everything is surrounded by a tag, so a web browser right now can see 'BOOOOO',

01:59.460 --> 02:00.980
and just print out 'BOOOOO'.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.420
But if you want to do it right, you'd want to put something like an 'H1'

02:05.430 --> 02:09.080
And an 'h1' tag.

02:09.660 --> 02:15.250
If I saved this and I refresh, we get what we call a 'header'.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.150
So that is a header and then one what '1' does one mean?

02:19.150 --> 02:23.810
Well it actually goes all the way up to 6.

02:23.920 --> 02:31.960
So if I change this to '2', and I'm not going to do every single one, let's just do another one 'h6'

02:32.630 --> 02:44.250
and if I save this, and refresh the page, you can see that there's different sizes in the text.

02:44.310 --> 02:45.690
So that's the header tag.

02:45.900 --> 02:55.150
And again if I scroll through the W3 Schools and I go to the 'h' you see over here that there's the header

02:55.170 --> 02:56.800
tags explained here.

02:57.100 --> 03:02.910
And this Web site is really really cool because you can actually click on 'Try it Yourself', and you can

03:02.910 --> 03:05.950
play around with different things.

03:08.190 --> 03:11.420
A quick run, and it changes it for you.

03:11.830 --> 03:16.070
So again, this is a really really good website for you to get familiar with all the tags.

03:16.480 --> 03:21.350
But, again we're going to stick to our website for now.

03:21.350 --> 03:28.160
Another thing that I want to introduce you to is something called a 'p' tag, or a paragraph tag. A paragraph

03:28.160 --> 03:32.580
tag lets you have paragraphs.

03:32.600 --> 03:39.830
So now if I refresh, well there's not much different from what we had before, which was no tags and just

03:39.830 --> 03:52.380
saving it, refresh but you can see the difference when I copy and paste this and have a few paragraphs

03:52.460 --> 03:55.280
versus this.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.290
Let's see what happens.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.780
I save this.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.640
You'll see over here that with Sublime Text it after I don't know what to say about maybe like 20 saves

04:04.940 --> 04:09.950
it'll ask you to make a purchase, because technically this is a non-registered one. You can ignore for now,

04:09.950 --> 04:11.150
just click 'Cancel'.

04:11.300 --> 04:15.740
Again it's just one annoying thing that will pop up every now and then.

04:16.180 --> 04:19.060
I actually have a registered Sublime Text, I just wanted to show you this error,

04:19.070 --> 04:21.500
so you're not surprised when you see it.

04:21.860 --> 04:25.220
You can use Sublime Text for as long as you need it, for free.

04:25.220 --> 04:30.410
When you start getting into the developer role and working full time with it, I do recommend that you make

04:30.410 --> 04:30.860
a purchase.

04:30.860 --> 04:32.450
It's a great program and -

04:32.670 --> 04:35.030
and you still get everything through the 'I'm registered'.

04:35.030 --> 04:38.760
You just have this pop up that shows up after a few saves.

04:39.260 --> 04:42.500
But anyways, from now on I'm going to be using a registered Sublime account.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.550
I just wanted to show you that error. If I refresh the page here,

04:45.620 --> 04:49.160
you'll see that I have the paragraphs show up nicely.

04:50.300 --> 04:55.650
But these unstructured pieces of text, well, everything is kind of in one line.

04:55.740 --> 05:00.740
And HTML doesn't really know what to do with it, so it puts everything all on one line.

05:00.740 --> 05:06.500
I also want to show you one other quick trick in Sublime Text, so writing this jibberish is not very

05:06.500 --> 05:09.510
exciting and kind of takes a bit of time.

05:09.860 --> 05:10.900
Developers are lazy.

05:10.900 --> 05:13.950
We want to make sure that everything is done fast and efficient.

05:13.970 --> 05:20.520
So if you actually put 'Lorem' here and then press 'Tab' you'll get Lorem Ipsum paragraphs.

05:20.540 --> 05:25.790
So let's do that and delete that. 'Lorem', 'Tab'.

05:26.210 --> 05:31.300
And then one more, 'Lorem', 'Tab'. Perfect.

05:31.350 --> 05:35.310
Let's save that and,  'Refresh', and we have nice paragraphs.

05:35.310 --> 05:44.030
As you can see we have some tags, and what we call 'nested tags', so you can see that the 'body' is the

05:44.030 --> 05:48.290
parent and Sublime Text actually lets you close and open these.

05:48.320 --> 05:54.630
So you have the 'body' tag, you have the header ('h1', etc.) tags, which are children of the 'body' tag.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.940
And then we have 'p' tags.

05:57.020 --> 06:00.080
A lot of people get confused in the naming.

06:00.260 --> 06:06.610
I've mentioned these as tags, so essentially anything that has this syntax is a tag.

06:06.890 --> 06:15.950
But this is called an 'h1 element' so that's when it's an entire block of functionality with content inside

06:15.950 --> 06:16.270
it.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.320
So again tags.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.670
And then this is an 'h1 element'.

06:21.830 --> 06:29.300
Again it's just naming but you'll hear tags and elements kind of used interchangeably but those are

06:29.300 --> 06:30.680
the specific differences.

06:30.680 --> 06:37.130
All right let's get into some of the more exciting things, let's say for example I really want to emphasize

06:37.220 --> 06:39.320
'Lorem ipsum' here.

06:39.460 --> 06:50.870
Well I can use another tag, a 'b' tag, and then we close it at 'Lorem ipsum'. Let's make that screen here a little

06:50.870 --> 06:51.350
bit bigger.

06:51.350 --> 06:52.760
Just so you can see.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.230
There you go.

06:54.740 --> 06:57.670
So we have the 'b' tags over here.

06:57.710 --> 07:02.080
And if I click 'Save', I refresh.

07:02.410 --> 07:04.220
- Oops, we don't want to translate this page.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.770
We see that this is now bolded. Again, let's make it a little bit bigger.

07:07.770 --> 07:08.390
There you go.

07:08.400 --> 07:15.780
Now this syntax is actually not used anymore, or is not recommended - obviously still works, but there was

07:15.780 --> 07:25.410
a problem that - HTML was initially used for websites that ran on computers, on PCs, on Macs. And now we have things

07:25.410 --> 07:32.100
such as mobile phones and iPads, although the bold text, and we actually have another one which was

07:32.160 --> 07:44.920
the italicised, 'i', although we had this, for most phones - some of them didn't have the ability to bold

07:44.950 --> 07:50.230
the text, and didn't have the ability to italicise, or some screen readers,

07:50.260 --> 07:56.880
which people who are visually impaired use, didn't really understand the meaning behind italicised

07:57.300 --> 07:57.890
and bold.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.320
So now we use something called, 'strong' for bold and 'Refresh'.

08:05.320 --> 08:14.240
And then for italicized we use, 'em' for emphasis.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.600
And there you go.

08:15.740 --> 08:23.190
Now, the reason this change was made was a move towards more - something called semantic HTML, and

08:23.190 --> 08:29.760
we'll get into that into a later lesson but just know that there are some tags that have evolved over

08:29.760 --> 08:33.930
the years and it's part of why HTML5 exists.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.270
We'll get into that a little bit more,

08:35.280 --> 08:38.050
but just wanted to give you a quick note on that.

08:38.100 --> 08:38.400
All right.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.690
I think that's enough for now.

08:39.690 --> 08:43.140
We're going to get into more tags in the next video. For now,

08:43.140 --> 08:45.030
play around and I'll see you in the next one.
