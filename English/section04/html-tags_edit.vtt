00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.670
Welcome back.

00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:08.149
In this video we're going to expand on our knowledge
and introduce you to a few more HTML tags and

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.270
make this website look a little bit
prettier than just, "Hellooooooooo there."

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.070
To get started I'm just going to move
the screens around so you can see better.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.850
All right.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.220
So we have left, and right, and again
just to make sure everything works.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:33.489
If I change anything here to, - and then I click
'Save', and then I refresh the page, I have everything

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.140
updating perfect. Now,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.389
these aren't the only HTML
tags that you'll encounter.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:49.929
There is actually a ton of them, and if you go back
to the 'w3schools.com' you'll see over here all

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.580
the HTML tags that exist.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.790
There's a lot of them.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.530
We're only going to be going through,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.099
I would say maybe, 10 or 15 or so because those are
the only ones that, well technically, that I've used

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.779
in many years of devolvement - there's a few
things on here that I've never even heard of.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.830
I've never used.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.870
You can always look up
and learn them yourself.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.079
But I'll say that there's about
10 or 15 tags that are used,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.989
ninety-nine percent of the time and
those are the ones that you'll encounter.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.890
So we'll go through some of those most popular ones
and HTML doesn't really get any harder than -

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.100
than this.

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:38.840
This is the syntax, as long as you get used to these
little signs and structure you're pretty much a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.230
HTML developer.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.310
So the first tag that I want to
introduce you to is the 'h1' tag.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.690
So the way that I have it
here is actually not right.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.339
You want to make sure that everything is surrounded by
a tag, so a web browser right now can see 'BOOOOO',

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.860
and just print out 'BOOOOO'.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.300
But if you want to do it right,
you'd want to put something like an 'H1'

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.960
And an 'h1' tag.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.130
If I saved this and I refresh,
we get what we call a 'header'.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.029
So that is a header and then
one what '1' does one mean?

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.690
Well it actually goes all the way up to 6.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.840
So if I change this to '2', and I'm not going to do
every single one, let's just do another one 'h6'

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:42.130
and if I save this, and refresh the page, you can
see that there's different sizes in the text.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.570
So that's the header tag.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:53.030
And again if I scroll through the W3 Schools and I go
to the 'h' you see over here that there's the header

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.680
tags explained here.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.789
And this website is really really cool because you
can actually click on 'Try it Yourself', and you can

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.830
play around with different things.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.300
Click run, and it changes it for you.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.650
So again, this is a really really good website
for you to get familiar with all the tags.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.929
But, again we're going to
stick to our website for now.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.739
Another thing that I want to introduce you to is something
called a 'p' tag, or a paragraph tag. A paragraph

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.560
tag lets you have paragraphs.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.809
So now if I refresh, well there's not much different
from what we had before, which was no tags and just

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:49.360
saving it, refresh but you can see the difference
when I copy and paste this and have a few paragraphs

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.260
versus this.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.270
Let's see what happens.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.760
I save this.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.620
You'll see over here that with Sublime Text it after
I don't know what to say about maybe like 20 saves

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.929
it'll ask you to make a purchase, because technically
this is a non-registered one. You can ignore for now,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.130
just click 'Cancel'.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.720
Again it's just one annoying thing
that will pop up every now and then.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.660
I actually have a registered Sublime Text,
I just wanted to show you this error,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.100
so you're not surprised when you see it.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.819
You can use Sublime Text for as
long as you need it, for free.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.009
When you start getting into the developer role and
working full time with it, I do recommend that you make

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.460
a purchase.

00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:29.050
It's a great program and -

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.629
and you still get everything
through the 'I'm registered'.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.460
You just have this pop up that
shows up after a few saves.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.099
But anyways, from now on I'm going to
be using a registered Sublime account.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.150
I just wanted to show you that error.
If I refresh the page here,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.760
you'll see that I have the
paragraphs show up nicely.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.250
But these unstructured pieces of text,
well, everything is kind of in one line.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.139
And HTML doesn't really know what to do with
it, so it puts everything all on one line.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.899
I also want to show you one other quick trick in
Sublime Text, so writing this jibberish is not very

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.910
exciting and kind of takes a bit of time.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.299
Developers are lazy.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.350
We want to make sure that everything
is done fast and efficient.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.920
So if you actually put 'Lorem' here and then
press 'Tab' you'll get Lorem Ipsum paragraphs.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.190
So let's do that and delete that.
'Lorem', 'Tab'.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.700
And then one more, 'Lorem', 'Tab'. Perfect.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.709
Let's save that and, 'Refresh',
and we have nice paragraphs.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:39.429
As you can see we have some tags, and what we call
'nested tags', so you can see that the 'body' is the

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.379
parent and Sublime Text actually
lets you close and open these.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.690
So you have the 'body' tag, you have the header ('h1',
etc.) tags, which are children of the 'body' tag.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.000
And then we have 'p' tags.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.140
A lot of people get confused in the naming.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.670
I've mentioned these as tags, so essentially
anything that has this syntax is a tag.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:11.009
But this is called an 'h1 element' so that's when it's
an entire block of functionality with content inside

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.330
it.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.379
So again tags.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.730
And then this is an 'h1 element'.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.519
Again it's just naming but you'll hear tags and
elements kind of used interchangeably but those are

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.900
the specific differences.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:31.740
All right let's get into some of the more exciting
things, let's say for example I really want to emphasize

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.930
'Lorem ipsum' here.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:45.479
Well I can use another tag, a 'b' tag, and then we close
it at 'Lorem ipsum'. Let's make that screen here a little

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.960
bit bigger.

00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:47.370
Just so you can see.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.840
There you go.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.280
So we have the 'b' tags over here.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.690
And if I click 'Save', I refresh.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.830
- Oops, we don't want
to translate this page.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.379
We see that this is now bolded.
Again, let's make it a little bit bigger.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.000
There you go.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:10.389
Now this syntax is actually not used anymore, or is not
recommended - obviously still works, but there was

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:20.019
a problem that - HTML was initially used for websites that
ran on computers, on PCs, on Macs. And now we have things

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:26.710
such as mobile phones and iPads, although the bold
text, and we actually have another one which was

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:39.530
the italicised, 'i', although we had this, for most
phones - some of them didn't have the ability to bold

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.840
the text, and didn't have the ability
to italicise, or some screen readers,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:51.329
which people who are visually impaired use, didn't
really understand the meaning behind italicised

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.030
and bold.

00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:59.349
So now we use something called,
'strong' for bold and 'Refresh'.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:06.570
And then for italicized we
use, 'em' for emphasis.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.530
And there you go.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:16.619
Now, the reason this change was made was a move
towards more - something called semantic HTML, and

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:23.189
we'll get into that into a later lesson but just
know that there are some tags that have evolved over

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.359
the years and it's part
of why HTML5 exists.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.700
We'll get into that a little bit more,

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.480
but just wanted to give
you a quick note on that.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.330
All right.

00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:33.619
I think that's enough for now.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.039
We're going to get into more
tags in the next video. For now,

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.840
play around and I'll
see you in the next one.
