And welcome to the student Q&amp;A section as students take this course,

00:06.360 --> 00:10.770
usually I get a bunch of questions. Some of them are really really good, some of them I get often.

00:10.980 --> 00:18.180
And we're going to use these Q&amp;A sections for me to make a reply video to answer some of those really

00:18.180 --> 00:19.160
really good questions.

00:19.200 --> 00:25.570
And the first thing we're going to tackle for this video is 'index.html'.

00:26.040 --> 00:33.870
If we go back to our example that we had, you noticed that I've always used 'index.html' as

00:33.870 --> 00:34.800
the first page.

00:34.830 --> 00:38.050
And then we created 'newpage.html'.

00:38.070 --> 00:41.940
Now you might be asking yourself why 'index.html'.

00:41.940 --> 00:48.890
Why not 'home.html', or 'apples.html'? And you could actually do that.

00:48.900 --> 00:54.090
But I can explain this really well by looking at this diagram.

00:54.090 --> 00:58.710
Most of the time there are more than a few html files.

00:58.740 --> 01:04.420
You saw that with our example we had our 'index.html' and also 'newpage.html'.

01:04.440 --> 01:11.340
But when we make that request to let's say google.com, how does the server know which html (file) to

01:11.340 --> 01:13.730
return first for the homepage?

01:13.920 --> 01:19.300
And you could go into the server and configure it and tell it you know what I want 'about.html' to

01:19.350 --> 01:28.920
be the first page. But, by default most servers just say, "I'll return 'index.html'- if I see 'index.html'

01:28.920 --> 01:31.550
in the servers, I'll just return that."

01:31.560 --> 01:36.720
So this is just a common practice that you'll see in a lot of the projects that a lot of the websites

01:36.720 --> 01:37.620
that you'll work with,

01:37.620 --> 01:43.710
is that 'index.html' is usually, you can think of it as the home-page, the first a HTML file

01:44.040 --> 01:46.580
that the server returns.

01:47.100 --> 01:54.000
And if anybody in the 'index.html' clicks on that link, then it will return whichever link they return.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.080
So there will be - let's say they click on 'About' anchor tag, then they'll get 'about.html'.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.090
So that's it.

02:00.180 --> 02:03.550
That is your answer to your question.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.100
I'll see in the next one. Bye-bye
