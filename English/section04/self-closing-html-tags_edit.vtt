00:00.450 --> 00:02.240
And welcome back.

00:02.300 --> 00:05.900
In this video we're going to be learning about self-closing tags.

00:06.090 --> 00:14.400
Up until this point we use all tags that have the opening and then the closing which has this slash

00:14.400 --> 00:15.430
in it.

00:15.480 --> 00:22.230
Now there are a few elements that don't have this syntax but they have something called 'self-closing

00:22.230 --> 00:22.890
tags'.

00:23.010 --> 00:29.630
So let's say here between Fuji and Honeycrisp I want to have a bit of a line break.

00:29.640 --> 00:36.490
I can use something like 'br' here and if I save this and I 'refresh',

00:36.690 --> 00:38.340
we have a little line break.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.800
There's also 'hr' which is horizontal line,

00:42.060 --> 00:46.790
so you get a horizontal line for refresh right through here.

00:46.890 --> 00:53.520
'hr' tags just have one single element, self-closing.

00:53.710 --> 01:00.640
You might also see something like this, and that is something from the old version of HTML, which

01:00.640 --> 01:02.480
uses xHTML.

01:02.860 --> 01:08.380
You can read up more about it on your own, but just keep in mind that with HTML5, we are just going

01:08.380 --> 01:09.260
to be using this.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.820
So obviously on web pages there's going to be images.

01:12.820 --> 01:16.310
So would it be nice if there was a picture of a Fuji apple here.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.820
Let's see how we can do it.

01:19.860 --> 01:25.050
So with an image tag, and let's think about this critically if I didn't know what an image tag is and

01:25.050 --> 01:34.340
I wanted to add an image to my small file, well if I Google "image HTML tag", again one of the

01:34.340 --> 01:43.970
first websites that pops up is the W3 Schools, and I'll show you exactly how an image tag works.

01:44.890 --> 01:51.230
If I click try yourself you can see it in action you can play around with but you can see here that

01:51.230 --> 01:54.560
an image tag is a self-closing tag.

01:54.650 --> 01:58.750
There's no closing image tags just just one single tag.

01:59.590 --> 02:06.670
And if I do image [img] and we have something called source here and this is something called an attribute

02:07.600 --> 02:13.630
some HTML tags can have something called attributes, which add special properties to the specific

02:13.630 --> 02:14.330
tag.

02:14.440 --> 02:21.940
So an attribute always has a value attached to it and the image source [img src].

02:21.940 --> 02:26.080
That's what it stands for, tells us where the image is coming from.

02:26.080 --> 02:38.760
So let's find an image of fuji apple let's go, images, oh, I like this one. Let's do 'view image' and give us the link

02:38.850 --> 02:41.100
of where this image is.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.760
So I'm just going to copy that paste it in here.

02:45.680 --> 02:51.950
Let's go back to our example here we can see here that there's a few more attributes that we can add

02:51.950 --> 02:53.080
to an image tag.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.730
But for now we can just leave it here close the tag.

02:57.740 --> 03:07.470
You can see that Sublime Text has the nice highlighting for us and if I save this go back to our website

03:07.980 --> 03:16.320
and I click refresh I get this massive fuji apple, and obviously that's that's too big.

03:16.390 --> 03:22.900
Ideally we can make it a little bit smaller again if we go back to the example you'll see that there

03:22.900 --> 03:32.500
has width and height so we can actually just copy that and add it to the attributes so that we specify

03:32.620 --> 03:33.240
the width.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.390
And this is in pixels [px].

03:34.390 --> 03:41.080
So I save that, I refresh and look at that we have the fuji apple, it looks very very pretty.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.600
Let's add the picture for honeycrisp as well.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.040
I'm going to do this fast.

03:47.070 --> 03:51.330
You should be able to just copy this image.

03:51.390 --> 03:55.680
And again we want to make it the same size as the previous one so I'm going to leave the width and height

03:55.740 --> 03:56.370
the same.

03:56.660 --> 04:00.520
And let's find a - an image of a honeycrisp apple.

04:00.520 --> 04:09.960
So, 'honeycrisp apple' and 'Images', it looks quite similar doesn't it?

04:10.140 --> 04:19.320
And 'view image' let's copy the source from here going to save that.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.000
Go back to our website and let's refresh and look at that.

04:23.150 --> 04:28.420
We have our apples. So, image tags are very very useful.

04:28.420 --> 04:33.860
You might be asking yourself, "what does the 'alt' attribute mean?"

04:33.920 --> 04:39.110
And this is something that you can actually read up on so if you scroll down if you look over here you

04:39.110 --> 04:43.940
can see that 'alt' specifies an alternate text for an image.

04:43.940 --> 04:50.510
So again, this is something that can be used by screen readers and you can define what the image is of.

04:50.510 --> 04:53.880
So, here the 'alt' is "smiley face".

04:53.930 --> 05:00.170
So when a screen reader reads it, it says, "Oh and this part of the website there is a smiley face".

05:00.170 --> 05:06.220
Just to recap, we learned about self-closing tags - which don't require

05:06.230 --> 05:08.750
two of them, so an opening and closing tag.

05:08.810 --> 05:09.940
Just a single one.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.490
So we use 'br' for line break.

05:13.490 --> 05:21.800
We used 'hr' for a horizontal line, and then we have the image tag that also has to have some attributes.

05:21.830 --> 05:26.320
So, it has a source which tells us where to grab the image from,

05:26.450 --> 05:33.440
it has a width attribute, a height attribute, with a value of 42 pixels, and 42.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.010
All right I'll see you in the next lesson.
