00:00.270 --> 00:03.780
Hello and welcome back to a very exciting section.

00:03.800 --> 00:04.680
Why is it exciting?

00:04.680 --> 00:11.370
Well, we finally get to code, and we're going to start off by learning HTML, and then finally building

00:11.400 --> 00:16.140
our very first website. In order for us to get started,

00:16.370 --> 00:19.920
we need to set up our environment, and we do that by -

00:19.920 --> 00:27.070
let's open up Google Chrome and we're going to search for 'Sublime Text 3'.

00:27.090 --> 00:31.140
This is a text editor that a lot of developers use.

00:31.140 --> 00:33.270
I myself have used it for years.

00:33.270 --> 00:34.650
I absolutely love it.

00:34.740 --> 00:37.530
In your day to day job you'll use something like this.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.500
I highly recommend Sublime Text.

00:39.900 --> 00:47.310
If you have a Mac version over here if you have a PC running Windows, you'll have the download link for

00:47.310 --> 00:48.290
Windows.

00:48.300 --> 00:56.340
So for me I'm going to download for the Mac and you can see here it's downloaded and I can drag it to

00:56.340 --> 01:02.910
my applications folder if I want and you can double click. And if this is your first time downloading Sublime

01:02.910 --> 01:07.860
Text, you get something like this to give it permission to load.

01:08.070 --> 01:12.360
And there you go, we have Sublime Text.

01:12.410 --> 01:21.210
Now what is a text editor? A text editor is a program that allows us to write code.

01:21.230 --> 01:27.500
You can see over here on the right hand side of Sublime Text that it just says 'Plain Text' so I can

01:27.500 --> 01:36.110
type anything that I want and there's nothing much different than if you wrote this in Word or a text

01:36.110 --> 01:42.360
file. But the part with a text editor, especially with something like Sublime, that's geared towards coding.

01:42.410 --> 01:50.000
If you click on 'Plain Text' here, you'll have a whole bunch of options of what type of code you're writing.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.750
So in our case we're doing HTML,

01:52.790 --> 01:58.170
so if I click on 'HTML', nothing changes except for the bottom part over here.

01:58.950 --> 02:07.780
But now if I type something, well everything looks the same, but if I start typing HTML, It'll

02:07.790 --> 02:10.730
actually recognize it and help with syntax.

02:10.760 --> 02:18.480
So here now if I write HTML, look at that you get a nice little color completion.

02:18.500 --> 02:24.930
So for us, for now, we're going to be writing HTML, you can see over here that there's different options

02:24.940 --> 02:26.550
there is - where is it...

02:26.570 --> 02:32.390
There's CSS, Javascript - which we'll learn later, so we're going to be using Sublime Text for this. For

02:32.390 --> 02:33.590
now,

02:33.590 --> 02:41.070
click on HTML, and let's write our very first web-page. In order for us to have a web page,

02:41.090 --> 02:45.600
we write 'HTML' which stands for HyperText Markup Language.

02:45.680 --> 02:46.850
So bear with me here,

02:46.850 --> 02:48.320
This is going to be new.

02:48.380 --> 02:53.060
But keep in mind that this is exactly what every single HTML page has.

02:53.060 --> 02:56.740
These are the set of rules that all HTML files must follow.

02:57.050 --> 02:58.330
And it goes like this.

02:58.400 --> 03:07.500
We define a doctype, and don't worry I'll get into what that means in the next video - I don't want caps

03:07.500 --> 03:08.170
here.

03:10.390 --> 03:17.200
Then we have 'html' and we close the tags: '/html'

03:17.200 --> 03:21.130
The second part, we have a 'head' and a closing '/head'.

03:21.640 --> 03:25.290
You can see over here, some patterns forming.

03:25.290 --> 03:33.580
Don't worry, I'll get back to these tags and explaining what they do, in a bit. And then we also have a 'body'

03:35.660 --> 03:37.040
and then closing tags, '/body'.

03:37.310 --> 03:50.740
And finally here in the 'head' we have something called a 'title', that so this over here, is the rule that

03:50.770 --> 03:56.450
every single HTML file must follow. So, just looking at this right now, without knowing any HTML,

03:56.490 --> 04:00.130
you can get an idea of what everything means.

04:00.130 --> 04:04.630
So 'html', we're defining that this is an HTML.

04:04.930 --> 04:10.630
We're saying that this is the 'head' of the HTML, with the title, and we're saying that this is the

04:10.630 --> 04:12.900
'body' of the HTML.

04:13.270 --> 04:14.830
So let's try something here.

04:14.890 --> 04:24.710
Let's save this file, and we're going to save it - let's do 'Desktop', and we're going to call it,

04:24.790 --> 04:31.420
 'index.html' - you can see that it's already completed the ‘html’ syntax for us. Save and we have

04:31.420 --> 04:32.320
an index.html

04:32.350 --> 04:33.550
 file here.

04:33.790 --> 04:41.140
Let's drag this all the way down to our Google Chrome and open it up and, well, nothing happens.

04:41.140 --> 04:44.370
But, lets, add a bit of text to it.

04:44.400 --> 04:50.470
So in the title, I'm going to say, "My first website!".

04:50.470 --> 04:57.320
And then in the body I'm just going to put "Hellooooooooo there.".

04:58.000 --> 04:58.320
OK.

04:58.410 --> 04:59.580
So if I save this,

05:03.010 --> 05:09.430
and just to show you, from now on I'm going to be doing 'CMD-S' to save, just to go faster.

05:09.700 --> 05:19.510
And now if I refresh this page I have, "Hellooooooooo there." and you can see the power over here, of what we just

05:19.510 --> 05:20.270
did.

05:20.350 --> 05:31.100
We have "Hellooooooooo there." as the text, which is in the body, and then we also have "My first web site!" as the

05:31.100 --> 05:31.780
title.

05:31.790 --> 05:37.670
And you can see over here in the file, that we're referencing 'index.html' on my Desktop.

05:37.730 --> 05:40.150
You can see here that we have 'html'.

05:40.400 --> 05:46.340
We have the 'head', which we haven't really talked about yet but, we see that the title is in the head, kind

05:46.340 --> 05:51.770
of like a header. And then we have the body which, by looking at this, we can assume that it's whatever

05:51.770 --> 05:57.560
shows up onto the web page. Before we expand on this and make it, a little bit prettier,

05:57.560 --> 05:59.650
because now it's just simple text.

05:59.660 --> 06:06.020
I want to reiterate the fact that what we've just done is very similar to what a server does.

06:06.380 --> 06:13.520
If we go back to our mock ups here, you remember that when we entered 'google.com' the servers send us

06:13.610 --> 06:20.840
an HTML file, that when we moved the 'index.html' file all the way down to Google Chrome, that's

06:20.840 --> 06:21.560
what we just did.

06:21.560 --> 06:30.710
We mimicked a server and we gave it to the browser to load up the HTML file and because browsers are

06:30.710 --> 06:38.100
built to know what HTML files are, it can read the syntax and say OK this is HTML.

06:38.310 --> 06:38.660
OK.

06:38.720 --> 06:43.750
You want my 'title' to be' "My first website!", and you want my 'body' to say "Hellooooooooo there."

06:44.510 --> 06:45.740
That's perfect.

06:45.740 --> 06:49.170
These are the default HTML rules.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.950
That you'll see all the time.

06:51.080 --> 06:55.180
It is a little bit confusing at first but this is it.

06:55.190 --> 06:58.680
You just have to remember that there is a tag.

06:58.820 --> 07:10.190
So, an 'html’ tag, a 'head' tag, a 'title' tag, a 'body' tag, and these tags usually have an opening and closing.

07:10.220 --> 07:14.750
There's some exceptions to this rule, and we'll get into that a little bit later on in the videos.

07:14.780 --> 07:16.590
But just remember this for now.

07:16.730 --> 07:22.910
So I wanted to try creating your very first web site and seeing how it works, and once you're done with

07:22.910 --> 07:23.210
that

07:23.230 --> 07:28.790
I want to show you that Sublime Text actually has a nice shortcut so you don't have to keep writing

07:28.850 --> 07:30.260
those tags over and over.

07:30.260 --> 07:37.100
So, the way you do that is you type in, 'html' now, and then press the 'Tab' key and it loads all this up for

07:37.100 --> 07:37.330
you.

07:37.400 --> 07:42.800
OK, so now that we've done this, I want you to go off and create your very first website.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.080
Now, I know it's very, very simple.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.330
You can put whatever you want in the title and you can put whatever you want

07:47.360 --> 07:52.970
in the body. And in the next video we're going to start expanding on our first website.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.870
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
