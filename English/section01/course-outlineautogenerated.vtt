00:00.740 --> 00:04.250
Let's talk about how this course will look like for you.

00:04.520 --> 00:10.310
Each section has some sort of actionable steps that you are able to follow such as building Web sites

00:10.370 --> 00:17.480
and sample projects and everything we use in this course is a tool that companies use in real life.

00:17.480 --> 00:18.590
They're the best of the best.

00:19.070 --> 00:21.070
So let's look at the course outline.

00:21.200 --> 00:27.590
The first part will be an introduction some basic concepts to get us familiar with the Web and how it

00:27.590 --> 00:28.760
works.

00:28.790 --> 00:33.910
We will start off with how the internet works what is the history of these technologies.

00:33.980 --> 00:39.140
We're going to talk about the history of the Web the Web browsers and I'll actually have you understand

00:39.140 --> 00:45.980
the underlying concepts of the Internet and how the technologies we have now have come to be where they

00:45.980 --> 00:46.150
are.

00:47.180 --> 00:49.790
And then we're going to learn a shim all five.

00:49.790 --> 00:56.510
Finally building our first Web site we'll also get into some advanced HMO where we're going to build

00:56.510 --> 01:01.160
some complex forms and get you really really good at this technology.

01:01.190 --> 01:08.850
We will then move into CSX which allows us to style our Web sites and make them beautiful.

01:09.100 --> 01:16.970
Afterwards we'll get into advanced CSX and using CSX three features like transitions and gradients in

01:16.970 --> 01:23.570
the advanced CSF section we'll create a background generator project that is going to be a lot of fun.

01:23.900 --> 01:30.380
Once we've mastered how to work with Web sites using a simple and CSX will then start learning about

01:30.380 --> 01:37.250
bootstrap for templates and building your own startup landing page that accepts e-mails and will actually

01:37.250 --> 01:42.230
store the e-mails of users as people who are interested in your startup.

01:42.230 --> 01:45.520
A very useful skill that you will definitely need in your career.

01:45.590 --> 01:48.350
Or if you have a business idea that you want to pursue.

01:48.350 --> 01:57.110
We will also dive into newer features of CSX like flex box my favorite CSX grid and get really really

01:57.110 --> 02:01.040
good at doing responsive layouts with CSX.

02:01.040 --> 02:05.230
Finally we finish off par one with career of a developer.

02:05.480 --> 02:09.390
What does a career of a developer actually entail.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.770
What are the salaries.

02:10.820 --> 02:17.000
What are the differences between a software developer mobile developer software engineer full stack

02:17.000 --> 02:18.470
developer.

02:18.470 --> 02:23.180
We're going to cover all that and we're also going to talk about the future trends and what skills do

02:23.180 --> 02:29.270
you need in the future from part one new move to our next section and here we'll start to introduce

02:29.270 --> 02:36.140
javascript and learn concepts that allow us to learn a real programming language and the most popular

02:36.140 --> 02:38.880
programming language which is javascript.

02:38.930 --> 02:45.770
We then move to Dom manipulation where we'll actually use javascript to create actions and behaviors

02:45.830 --> 02:46.610
to our Web site.

02:46.610 --> 02:47.770
So they're interactive.

02:48.140 --> 02:53.750
And then finally we're going to learn some advanced JavaScript concepts so that we can use javascript

02:53.870 --> 02:57.140
to control the machines around us.

02:57.200 --> 03:03.980
Now just knowing a simple CFS and Javascript is not good enough and you won't be able to grow in your

03:03.980 --> 03:08.400
role and command a higher salary just with those three skills.

03:08.540 --> 03:13.790
I'm going to be teaching you these things coming up because these are the things you should know so

03:13.790 --> 03:15.680
that you are miles ahead of the rest.

03:16.580 --> 03:21.440
So after the javascript section we're going to start getting into the command line and working with

03:21.440 --> 03:22.160
the terminal.

03:22.250 --> 03:27.290
We then learn about developer environments and I'll actually show you what my developer environment

03:27.310 --> 03:29.930
on my computer looks like when I'm working.

03:30.230 --> 03:35.990
We'll be setting up our own computers with all the tools necessary of a real life developer so you can

03:35.990 --> 03:39.980
use the same setup when you go and work for somebody or for yourself.

03:39.980 --> 03:42.470
We will then learn about get and get hub.

03:42.470 --> 03:48.710
Probably the most important tools of a developer and I'll show you how teams work with these technologies

03:48.980 --> 03:51.950
to create collaborative software.

03:51.950 --> 03:55.540
We then get into a fun section which is a day in the life of a developer.

03:55.580 --> 04:02.890
I'll show you what a day today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. what it looks like and what tools you'll use.

04:02.930 --> 04:07.400
I will take you through a sample day at a tech company just so that's on your first day of the job.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.730
You won't be surprised.

04:08.810 --> 04:15.050
We will then jump to NPM and NPM scripts a way for developers to share their code and it's going to

04:15.050 --> 04:19.200
open up a whole world of possibilities in this section.

04:19.240 --> 04:23.960
We're also going to create our own customizable portfolio project.

04:23.960 --> 04:30.620
So moving forward you can add the projects from this course to your Web site and have it as your online

04:30.740 --> 04:32.140
resonate.

04:32.150 --> 04:35.590
Finally we finish off part two with react.

04:35.600 --> 04:42.500
J Yes you'll learn the library that companies like Netflix Facebook and Instagram used to build fast

04:42.680 --> 04:44.900
scalable applications.

04:44.900 --> 04:48.260
This is one of the highest in demand skills in the industry.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.570
It's so much fun.

04:49.700 --> 04:53.810
And I'm really really excited about that section from part two.

04:53.870 --> 05:00.950
We'll move on to the world outside of just the front end and we're going to learn about HDP Jason Ajax

05:01.010 --> 05:04.100
something that will open up a world of possibilities.

05:04.280 --> 05:08.570
We'll learn about the back and basics and what backend developers do.

05:08.660 --> 05:14.420
And then finally I'll introduce you to some API is what API is are and definitely some really interesting

05:14.450 --> 05:16.040
APIs that are out there.

05:16.040 --> 05:21.920
This section is really going to open up your world from just being a front end developer that is really

05:21.920 --> 05:26.990
good at building Web sites to somebody that can create really dynamic applications.

05:26.990 --> 05:29.450
And it will set us up for Part 4.

05:29.450 --> 05:31.800
This is where it gets really really fun.

05:31.820 --> 05:37.760
We're gonna start working on our final project called smart brain and we're gonna start off by working

05:37.760 --> 05:43.880
on the front end that is using CSX javascript ECMO and react.

05:43.880 --> 05:49.290
We're going to build an image recognition app that's gonna be really really fun.

05:49.310 --> 05:56.980
You submit a U.R.L. and using a machine learning API we're gonna detect to see if in that photo there

05:56.980 --> 06:01.620
is a face and then detect where that faces with a square box.

06:01.700 --> 06:07.520
We're gonna create a sign and form a registration form and it's gonna be really really impressive something

06:07.520 --> 06:13.580
that you're gonna be able to use in your portfolio and impress future employers or clients.

06:13.580 --> 06:19.020
We then take a break from the smart brain project to introduce you to know us and express.

06:19.340 --> 06:25.130
This is where I show you how to build a server how to create a RESTful API so that when we get into

06:25.130 --> 06:31.130
the next section the smart brain server section we build our own server so that we're actually able

06:31.130 --> 06:39.650
to communicate with the server over a CTP and sign into our app sign out have profiles and do all sorts

06:39.650 --> 06:41.920
of really interesting things from there.

06:41.930 --> 06:47.600
We again take a break and learn about databases a really complex topic but I'm going to make it simple

06:47.600 --> 06:53.270
for you to understand how they work and in the next section we're actually going to create our own database

06:53.750 --> 07:01.190
using post graphs and connected to our server so that at the end you'll have a fully working app that

07:01.190 --> 07:09.380
has a front end client Web site a back end server and a server that's working with a database pretty

07:09.380 --> 07:11.840
much a full fledged application.

07:11.840 --> 07:17.240
And finally we're going to deploy and launch that application so you know exactly how to put a real

07:17.240 --> 07:23.480
life app that is secure and won't get hacked on the web and don't worry I'm going to provide all false

07:23.480 --> 07:29.270
for you throughout the sections so that you can just add them to your portfolio or you can work along

07:29.270 --> 07:32.780
the videos as well depending on what your learning style is.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.690
You can follow along whichever way works best for you.

07:35.840 --> 07:42.140
And at the end of the course I'm also going to have a quick little section of some of my favorite resources

07:42.140 --> 07:42.950
to get hired.

07:42.980 --> 07:49.880
Some of my own advice on finding a job of your dreams by the end of this course you're going to learn

07:49.880 --> 07:53.350
the skills that allow you to apply for jobs in the following roles.

07:53.360 --> 07:59.570
Web developer software developer front end developer javascript developer or a full stack developer

08:00.010 --> 08:03.840
you're going to learn the technologies that are actually being used behind tech companies.

08:03.860 --> 08:06.560
You're going to be able to build your own Web sites and applications.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.510
But most importantly you're going to master fundamental concepts in web development so that it sets

08:11.510 --> 08:14.330
you up for a bright long career.

08:14.330 --> 08:19.880
I also want to make this course interactive I'll be making videos of student projects and what others

08:19.880 --> 08:21.380
have built in this course like you.

08:21.560 --> 08:28.100
I'll also have Q and A videos where based on the most popular questions or the most popular topics I'm

08:28.100 --> 08:35.350
going to create new videos as they are suggested we have a lot to cover but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

08:36.530 --> 08:37.380
Let's get started.
