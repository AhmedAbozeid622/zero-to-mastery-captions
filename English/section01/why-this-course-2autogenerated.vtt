I'm Andrei, a senior software developer that has consulted and worked for some of the biggest tech firms 

3
00:17.250 --> 00:21.540
both in Toronto and Silicon Valley. As an educator,

4
00:21.600 --> 00:29.540
Over 60,000 programmers have taken my courses last year alone and I have succeeded in becoming web developers.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.620
Here's the thing:

6
00:31.110 --> 00:33.140
I have been in your shoes before.

7
00:33.160 --> 00:40.950
There's so much information out there on the internet so many courses, video tutorials, classes, and books

8
00:41.110 --> 00:42.370
that you can read.

9
00:42.810 --> 00:49.200
Most courses are outdated teaching less valuable skills like jQuery or PHP.

10
00:49.530 --> 00:55.110
Other courses just don't cover the full spectrum of technologies that you actually need to become a well

11
00:55.120 --> 01:00.350
respected programmer and they only cover the easy things. In this course,

12
01:00.540 --> 01:06.940
we won't be taking any shortcuts but we won't be wasting our time on skills that are outdated either.

13
01:07.170 --> 01:09.420
This course is all about efficiency.

14

of the biggest firms like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix.

17
01:29.600 --> 01:35.870
We will go from understanding how the Internet works to building a final project, together, where we build

18
01:35.870 --> 01:44.000
an image recognition app, by creating the front end with React, javascript, HTML and CSS. A server

19
01:44.300 --> 01:52.520
with Node and Express and a database using PostgreSQL. All built from scratch by ourselves.

20
01:52.520 --> 01:57.350
And don't worry, you'll learn what all these mean. Along the way,

21
01:57.530 --> 02:03.910

We all started zero.

32
02:45.540 --> 02:48.140
