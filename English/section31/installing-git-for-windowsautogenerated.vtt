WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:06.630
And will come back let's install kit for Windows for this.

00:06.630 --> 00:12.510
We picked the official guide for windows all over which we find we are by our group.

00:13.170 --> 00:19.130
After you click on the first result it starts to download immediately.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.840
I'll close this because I've already downloaded.

00:23.220 --> 00:26.700
And let's start the install.

00:26.970 --> 00:33.970
This is the usual text and terms you'll see if installed software hit next here.

00:34.290 --> 00:37.070
Just leave the default directory.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.080
Here we also leave everything.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.120
Yes we wanna call it.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.370
Get home.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.750
What is this.

00:46.230 --> 00:54.510
Hey you can choose your default editor which would be used for either team to dot get configuration

00:54.510 --> 00:55.600
files.

00:55.890 --> 01:00.900
In our case because you supplied text we will also select supplied text here.

01:01.210 --> 01:09.960
Oh what happened happens now the next part got to say will just hit back and next and your gets to the

01:09.960 --> 01:11.970
next part of the game.

01:12.450 --> 01:21.840
Seems like a little park but it worked it this way here can choose what you want to install to get comment

01:21.870 --> 01:22.840
for.

01:23.280 --> 01:27.300
I would highly recommend to choose this option this makes.

01:27.300 --> 01:31.910
Also to get a comment on the table in your windows command prompt.

01:32.580 --> 01:38.460
You have also the option you get for get bash only because with this installer also to get beshe get

01:38.460 --> 01:42.840
installed and the last one you see here a red alert.

01:43.620 --> 01:48.460
You shouldn't choose this because you have to be really sure what you're doing.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.690
So we just leave the second option and go with this one.

01:53.400 --> 02:01.980
Yes we also want to use this library and check out Windows style comment unique style line and things.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.470
What does this mean.

02:03.840 --> 02:11.580
Well if you work on a project which would be mainly built with a Unix like system like Mac or Linux

02:12.990 --> 02:18.570
you would have problems because Windows Thorus the line and things in a different way than a Unix machine

02:18.570 --> 02:19.530
would do it.

02:19.980 --> 02:23.040
So you want to choose the first option here.

02:23.070 --> 02:30.640
This will also make for you possible to work on files which were build up with Unix style systems.

02:30.810 --> 02:40.020
So next here yes we also want to use min t t y terminal because it's default mode.

02:41.010 --> 02:44.500
Yes we also want to enable the file caching and the credential manager.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.760
This is a very useful tool for good.

02:47.850 --> 02:51.610
No we just don't want any experience by now.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.380
Just hit install.

02:54.060 --> 02:55.920
So let me fast forward this for you.

02:55.930 --> 02:59.890
That you don't have to wait.

02:59.910 --> 03:00.710
All right.

03:00.840 --> 03:06.710
It's finished enough though we don't want to fuel the release notes at the finish.

03:06.780 --> 03:08.270
Let me close this.

03:08.730 --> 03:17.750
And now let's look if it gets installed probably by hitting the command get the ash the ash version.

03:17.750 --> 03:21.960
You will see the installed version on the system.

03:21.990 --> 03:25.190
All right get version two point nineteen point one.

03:25.230 --> 03:26.170
Point windows.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.540
Point one looks like that it worked.

03:30.540 --> 03:34.360
Now to really be sure that this has already worked.

03:34.650 --> 03:36.430
Let's clone the repo.

03:37.110 --> 03:43.660
I would choose one repo which I made.

03:43.950 --> 03:47.230
And let's go with the shopping cart.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.060
Copy to clipboard.

03:49.170 --> 03:52.870
Come let me minimize this.

03:53.130 --> 04:04.890
And now let's move into the directory which are already prepared to get demo and get clone right click

04:04.920 --> 04:08.830
would automatically paste the link in the command prompt.

04:08.950 --> 04:13.870
Hit enter and all right it worked.

04:13.870 --> 04:22.600
Now let's change into this directory and let us make a little change so that we can come cam committed

04:22.900 --> 04:30.580
to the actual the Commons for changing into a directory and not get open with my studio code.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.910
Now let's make a little change get it done today.

04:34.930 --> 04:36.760
This seems to be really important.

04:37.090 --> 04:39.530
Adding three exclamation marks.

04:39.670 --> 04:43.270
Let me save this and close it again.

04:43.270 --> 04:44.140
Now let's check.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.560
Why get status right.

04:47.670 --> 04:49.680
In the Stone Age him l.

04:49.740 --> 04:54.490
Now let's add it to our commet list with.

04:54.490 --> 04:56.380
Get home at.

04:56.380 --> 05:06.020
Thought you were at it and get commit Desch and x x collimation marks.

05:06.580 --> 05:08.390
Can't type today.

05:12.370 --> 05:13.040
All right.

05:13.070 --> 05:18.390
And now let's try to push it and try it out if it really work as expected.

05:18.610 --> 05:24.650
You push or read Jam Master.

05:24.650 --> 05:25.380
All right.

05:25.370 --> 05:26.910
It seems to be worked.

05:26.990 --> 05:30.490
Let's stop to double check it in my report.

05:31.220 --> 05:33.460
Let me refresh this.

05:33.730 --> 05:39.070
All right explanation marks with an exclamation mark because it's really important.

05:39.470 --> 05:41.660
Twenty six seconds to go.

05:41.870 --> 05:44.010
Looks like it worked.

05:44.210 --> 05:47.300
And this is how you install it on Windows.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.920
And the next lecture we gonna talk about how to install no ts on the Windows machines.

05:52.150 --> 05:53.350
I'll see the next one.
