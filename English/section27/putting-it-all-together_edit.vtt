00:00.700 --> 00:03.260
Welcome back. It's the moment of truth.

00:03.430 --> 00:04.790
We've set up our database.

00:04.810 --> 00:10.610
We've connected it to the server and now we should have our front end working.

00:10.780 --> 00:15.140
We might have a little bit cleanup that we need to do but let's test everything out.

00:15.370 --> 00:22.850
I'm going to create a new user and this new user - well first of all since she doesn't exist let's test

00:22.850 --> 00:23.250
that out.

00:23.260 --> 00:25.250
I shouldn't be able to sign it.

00:25.330 --> 00:26.640
I'm going to call her.

00:26.740 --> 00:29.490
Yolanda at gmail dot com.

00:29.740 --> 00:34.870
Her password will be trees.

00:35.390 --> 00:36.180
I sign in

00:39.790 --> 00:41.610
and I get an error.

00:42.450 --> 00:44.280
Fail to load resources.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.350
But I shouldn't be able to sign in.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.050
Right.

00:47.050 --> 00:50.100
So let's go to the front end and fix this issue.

00:54.940 --> 00:56.390
In the app dot js

00:56.390 --> 00:57.770
When we sign in

01:05.530 --> 01:16.990
we see that we're grabbing the signin and if we get a response we then load the users with that response.

01:18.080 --> 01:27.350
And you might remember if we go back to our server that with signin if anything fails I give back.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.800
Json. and Json,

01:30.880 --> 01:37.870
well technically, that's a piece of string that we're going to have and that will be true.

01:41.770 --> 01:50.790
In our case we can just check that there is a users dot id so we can just check that the user has

01:51.770 --> 01:53.280
an ID.

01:53.300 --> 02:03.720
All right let's give that a go I'll sign with Yolanda at gmail dot com COM and we'll do.

02:03.950 --> 02:04.580
hello as her

02:04.610 --> 02:05.640
password.

02:05.900 --> 02:10.090
No it doesn't let me sign it and I can display an error message here.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.660
But for now that's working.

02:11.660 --> 02:12.670
So let's register

02:12.680 --> 02:16.060
Yolanda. Click register.

02:16.470 --> 02:21.300
Yolanda will have Yolanda at gmail dot com.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.050
We'll have.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.910
hello as her password.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.670
Click register.

02:26.670 --> 02:30.230
All right Yolanda your current entry count is zero.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.450
Let's find a face that Yolanda can use.

02:36.070 --> 02:37.540
Ma'am we can use this face

02:40.560 --> 02:42.010
We'll press it in here.

02:43.790 --> 02:46.040
It's detecting the face that's awesome.

02:46.040 --> 02:50.340
Yolanda your current entry count is one.

02:50.510 --> 02:52.120
Let's sign out.

02:52.870 --> 03:02.290
And now if you go to sign in and do Yolanda at gmail dot com and get

03:02.740 --> 03:03.710
hello.

03:03.870 --> 03:06.050
I click sign in.

03:06.070 --> 03:07.820
That is awesome.

03:08.730 --> 03:22.290
If I sign out and let's enter a wrong password for Yolanda. If I do Yolanda at jibberish it doesn't let

03:22.290 --> 03:24.920
me sign in.

03:24.930 --> 03:33.230
If you look at the console we have the service responded with 400. Awesome.

03:33.680 --> 03:41.500
So we have everything working as we want it to.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.680
Let's just submit the same image all over again

03:47.730 --> 03:52.610
and look at that current entry count is two. Amazing.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.690
We have our app working.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.160
Good job getting this far.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.640
So excited that we got this to work.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.120
I'll see in the next one.

04:03.310 --> 04:03.560
Bye-bye.
