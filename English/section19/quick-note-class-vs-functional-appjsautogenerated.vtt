WEBVTT

00:01.310 --> 00:02.560
Welcome back.

00:02.630 --> 00:08.390
Now with the new version of create react app there's a few minor changes from what I'm going to show

00:08.390 --> 00:10.190
you in the next coming video.

00:10.400 --> 00:19.490
If we go to the source folder and we go to index dot J.S. you'll notice that one this service worker

00:19.910 --> 00:23.990
is now automatically on registered.

00:24.050 --> 00:27.070
Now a service worker is something that we don't have to worry about.

00:27.080 --> 00:32.810
It's something that allows us to do something called progressive web apps which I talk about in Part

00:32.800 --> 00:35.350
2 of this course now.

00:35.350 --> 00:42.280
Originally this was registered automatically but now it's on registered so that we technically don't

00:42.280 --> 00:48.710
use this service worker until we need to but we don't need to worry about that next.

00:48.730 --> 00:56.270
If we look into the app file you'll notice a big change here.

00:56.330 --> 01:05.780
Well we have the logo as an SPG now but the big important change is that this is now a function versus

01:06.140 --> 01:12.410
a class now originally before this newest version of Cary reactor.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.870
This used to be a class.

01:14.910 --> 01:16.880
Now don't worry about the difference.

01:16.890 --> 01:22.710
We actually cover the topic later on in the section when we talk about class components and functional

01:22.770 --> 01:29.650
components so for now in order for us to get ready for the next lesson I want to convert this into how

01:29.650 --> 01:32.890
it originally was as a class.

01:32.890 --> 01:42.340
So in order to test this what we'll do is just run NPM start to make sure that our project runs we will

01:42.340 --> 01:43.060
look at that.

01:43.060 --> 01:46.600
We have a nice little Cory react app logo.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.440
They love changing the home page every time there's a big update.

01:50.440 --> 01:50.620
All right.

01:50.620 --> 01:59.770
So this is running and all we want to do is update this too originally how it was it's actually quite

01:59.920 --> 02:00.910
simple.

02:00.940 --> 02:06.610
And by the way I'll provide the code for you so I can just copy and pasted after this lesson so we can

02:06.610 --> 02:08.630
just do a class now.

02:08.710 --> 02:23.170
So it's class app extends and we extend from react so that we say react dot component which is a property

02:23.350 --> 02:30.660
on this react that we import we don't need the parentheses anymore because this is a class.

02:30.770 --> 02:41.190
And then finally instead of returning we use a render here like this and this render

02:43.930 --> 02:55.800
will return this whole piece so we can remove this and in brackets here just return

03:02.880 --> 03:11.570
so fight safe here and now I refresh everything should still be working now.

03:11.600 --> 03:17.130
Moving forward we're going to use this setup to learn about react and don't worry.

03:17.150 --> 03:22.520
I know this looks intimidating but we're going to decipher it and learn react by the end of the section.

03:22.520 --> 03:23.140
Let's get started.
