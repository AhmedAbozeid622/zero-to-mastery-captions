00:02.040 --> 00:03.210
Welcome back.

00:03.570 --> 00:10.610
Before we start learning about redux we need to talk about something called state management.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.440
We've heard this word before - state.

00:12.530 --> 00:13.050
Right.

00:13.190 --> 00:14.690
When building a react app.

00:14.720 --> 00:24.300
We had this.state and state described what our app should look like. If we remember this, well, 

00:27.630 --> 00:36.750
react is simply a group of components that are rendered in a tree like structure.

00:36.840 --> 00:41.420
So this would be the app.js for example.

00:41.560 --> 00:48.390
And each one of these components would have state for example the red dots over here.

00:48.700 --> 00:49.750
They have state.

00:49.750 --> 00:57.730
So for example this app component will have a state of signed in as, and let's say the state is user

00:57.730 --> 01:06.340
in that case this user component might have a state of user "Mitch" or if signed in as 

01:06.340 --> 01:14.200
is "Admin" it might render the admin component and any time you see the blue dot that means there was a

01:14.200 --> 01:21.340
change so if there's a change here it can update something into this component and we render.

01:21.640 --> 01:31.380
And we did this in react and I want you to think of State as memory. An app needs to remember things

01:31.440 --> 01:40.240
in order to work otherwise we would just have simple html web pages like before.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.340
Remember this Keiko Corp Web site.

01:43.490 --> 01:46.940
This really doesn't have any state, does it.

01:48.050 --> 01:57.230
Each time we show the exact same web page to whoever is using it. This page has no idea of who the user

01:57.230 --> 02:03.740
is or any interactions that I'm having - it's mainly just text.

02:03.810 --> 02:07.530
Now the RoboFriends app - that's different.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.880
It has state.

02:09.330 --> 02:14.880
Well mostly because we wrote it and we had the this.state but we can interact with it.

02:14.940 --> 02:16.450
I can type in here.

02:17.400 --> 02:25.360
Leanne and I have a state of the search box having L-E-A in it.

02:25.560 --> 02:36.650
And the robots being filtered with just Leanne. State describes how our app should look. Our app, our Robo-

02:36.650 --> 02:46.520
friends app right now should look like this with just one robot card because the state is of a search

02:46.520 --> 02:50.540
box having the letters L-E-A inside of it.

02:51.570 --> 03:00.660
Now with a simple app like the robo friends ap0,p state it was pretty easy to understand, but state management

03:00.900 --> 03:02.780
is a really hard problem

03:02.880 --> 03:10.340
as our apps get bigger and bigger, and bigger. And you'll actually see in the later part of the course when

03:10.340 --> 03:15.180
we start working on the smart brain app which does the image recognition.

03:16.720 --> 03:24.430
You'll notice how the state gets more and more complicated and your head starts to hurt because you

03:24.430 --> 03:26.770
have to keep track of all these things happening.

03:28.180 --> 03:35.380
So again, with a simple react app we can have nice views and maybe have different states and different

03:35.380 --> 03:39.680
components but eventually as our app gets bigger.

03:39.760 --> 03:49.150
We end up with something like this where we have more and more components more and more state within

03:49.150 --> 03:55.540
that component or we can have one massive state at the very top here which also gets pretty hard and

03:55.960 --> 03:59.090
all these blue dots, as they update,

03:59.110 --> 04:04.180
they also have to update the state and then re-render.

04:04.380 --> 04:11.070
And this example here is just a little diagram but you can see with all these arrows how confusing it's

04:11.070 --> 04:17.520
going to get and keeping track of all this state is really, really hard.

04:17.550 --> 04:23.060
So we need some form of a state management, and redux.

04:23.060 --> 04:25.070
solves this problem for us.

04:25.070 --> 04:32.210
How could we make this diagram simpler and make things easier to understand in our heads as developers?

04:32.870 --> 04:35.060
Redux came up with a novel concept.

04:36.470 --> 04:39.750
What if we just remove all the state,

04:39.980 --> 04:43.050
so this.state from all the components?

04:43.220 --> 04:45.390
What if we just have props.

04:45.620 --> 04:49.650
So all these components just have props being passed down.

04:50.000 --> 05:00.150
And now the state, we keep it in a store. And a store is simply just the state which is this.state

05:00.180 --> 05:01.700
that react had.

05:01.860 --> 05:05.960
But in one massive object just like you see here.

05:06.120 --> 05:14.940
So one single object that describes how our app should look and all we do is just pass down that state

05:15.300 --> 05:18.840
to whichever component needs it as props.

05:19.750 --> 05:30.070
So our diagram from looking like this with just react can go to looking like this with redux where none

05:30.070 --> 05:32.690
of the components need to hold state anymore.

05:32.860 --> 05:41.020
And we can have one massive object that describes our entire app and whichever component needs that

05:41.020 --> 05:43.440
prop can just be passed down to it.

05:44.320 --> 05:51.670
And any updates that happen go through the state, the state gets modified and then we pass down that

05:51.670 --> 05:59.800
information to the component. This diagram might be confusing without actually coding anything.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.010
And we'll come back to it,

06:01.010 --> 06:02.780
so this makes sense.

06:02.990 --> 06:11.230
But even just visually you can see that this diagram looks a lot simpler than the diagram before it.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.630
We have a lot less arrows and everything just flows nicer.

06:15.680 --> 06:20.910
So as we go through the videos you're going to get more and more familiar with this idea of state management.

06:20.930 --> 06:28.430
But I wanted to keep in mind that, that is what redux is solving. Redux is a library that makes state

06:28.430 --> 06:34.100
management easier, not only for reac but for any tools that we use.

06:34.220 --> 06:36.810
It just happens to work really really well with react.

06:37.400 --> 06:44.870
And redux actually got inspiration from database design. From things such as events sourcing or CQRS

06:45.230 --> 06:49.400
which you can read up more on. Databases had the same problem.

06:49.520 --> 06:57.530
All these updates and all these changes happened but we needed a way to make sure that all these changes

06:57.890 --> 07:00.950
are organized in a nice cohesive way.

07:02.120 --> 07:02.730
All right.

07:02.860 --> 07:08.580
Well let's get into the next video and get a little bit deeper with redux.

07:08.690 --> 07:09.680
I'll see you in the next one. Bye bye.
