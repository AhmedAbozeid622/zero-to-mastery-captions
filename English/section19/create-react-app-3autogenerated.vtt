Hey.

00:01.440 --> 00:07.680
Yep it's me again talking about create react app because while they constantly keep updating create

00:07.680 --> 00:09.510
react app but we know that right.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.580
Tools are constantly being updated.

00:12.720 --> 00:20.460
Now there's actually a new easier way of starting a create react app project and I'll link to the resource

00:20.910 --> 00:22.280
but create react app.

00:22.320 --> 00:32.050
Well on top of having its own page now also uses this command to actually create an app.

00:32.050 --> 00:41.370
Let's have a look. So in the past we would do something like create-react-app and create our own project.

00:41.370 --> 00:48.890
But now instead of us having to install create-react-app by using npm install we can now just do npx

00:48.890 --> 01:00.630
and npx is actually a tool that is a package run or tool that comes with any version of NPM 5.2

01:00.700 --> 01:05.620
or higher which if you're watching the video now you should have and because we've talked about how

01:05.620 --> 01:12.630
to update our NPM. nNow instead of us having to install create react app now we can run npx create-react-app

01:12.630 --> 01:15.820
and whatever we want to call our app.

01:15.930 --> 01:23.940
So if I do let's say create react app and we'll call this project let's call it moooooo it's a cows project

01:24.240 --> 01:34.540
if I now run this all right there we have it we have our project so that now I can cd into moooooo and

01:34.560 --> 01:38.300
if I open the project there we go.

01:38.320 --> 01:44.800
We have all our files that we're familiar with with the latest version of react and react scripts which

01:44.800 --> 01:47.560
again that is that create react.

01:47.740 --> 01:53.770
Now in your case I wanted to create a project that is called robofriends because in the upcoming lessons

01:53.770 --> 01:59.320
we're going to create a robofriends app which is gonna be a lot of fun by the way.

01:59.320 --> 02:05.470
If you want to learn more about npx I'll link to a nice resource that you can read more about it in

02:05.470 --> 02:05.970
this video.

02:06.480 --> 02:06.990
All right.

02:07.090 --> 02:07.920
That was it.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.370
Nice and easy.

02:09.370 --> 02:10.870
I'll see in the next one.

02:10.930 --> 02:11.170
Bye bye.
