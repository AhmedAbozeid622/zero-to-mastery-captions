WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:01.700
We'll come back.

00:02.070 --> 00:08.190
I wanted to add a quick video to let you know of a few updates Crais react up that we used in the previous

00:08.190 --> 00:11.060
video is now a little bit outdated.

00:11.430 --> 00:18.840
And there's something called create react app 2.0 just a newer version of Cray react up that has a few

00:18.900 --> 00:25.430
other features that actually won't get in the way to much with what we do in the next couple of videos.

00:25.850 --> 00:30.960
And if you want to read about it you can read about the feature set they're mostly advanced so we don't

00:30.960 --> 00:38.100
need to worry too much about it but it's good to know that as libraries evolve you're going to see changes

00:38.130 --> 00:39.330
and differences.

00:39.330 --> 00:45.330
And if you are working on a project it's good to keep an eye out on the libraries that you're using

00:45.540 --> 00:52.890
so that you're able to update them because updates usually mean better performance better experience

00:52.980 --> 00:54.360
with libraries.

00:54.360 --> 01:01.470
So it's always good to keep things updated if they make sense and most of the times people that create

01:01.470 --> 01:07.980
these are going to try really really hard to make your experience and transitioning to that upgrade

01:07.980 --> 01:08.960
really easy.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.210
So let's have a look at Create react up 2.0.

01:12.450 --> 01:20.570
And one show you how it looks and to show you how to create your app in case this happens in the future.

01:22.140 --> 01:33.160
First off when we run create re-act up I will call this project new re-act is going to create a package

01:33.160 --> 01:33.970
for us.

01:33.970 --> 01:34.980
Nothing's changed.

01:34.990 --> 01:36.100
Just like before.

01:36.200 --> 01:42.870
A nice simple command that does everything for us so we can create our re-act project.

01:42.880 --> 01:43.470
There we go.

01:45.530 --> 01:53.330
Now if we open this in subline or actually let's clear this and make sure we go into the new folder

01:53.330 --> 01:55.480
so you react.

01:55.490 --> 02:00.880
And if I open this sublime everything is pretty much the same.

02:00.890 --> 02:03.930
There's a few minor changes that we don't need to worry about.

02:03.980 --> 02:05.680
All we want to check is that package.json

02:05.700 --> 02:16.000
we have the new version which is 2.1.1 the latest version and if I run NPM start here

02:19.280 --> 02:25.730
the only changes that you'll really see is all this nicer looking front page.

02:25.730 --> 02:28.900
So don't get startled if that's different from the previous video.

02:28.910 --> 02:32.960
Like I said this is just an upgraded version.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.390
But let's talk about how this might be useful to you.

02:36.560 --> 02:45.830
You see in this project we're going to be creating our robofriends app and I actually have the finished

02:45.920 --> 02:54.160
version of our robofriends right over here free look at the files we see that we have our project in

02:54.160 --> 02:54.770
here.

02:55.270 --> 03:01.700
But this is an outdated version that we're going to be using throughout the next couple of videos.

03:02.200 --> 03:08.140
But let's say you working at a company and the boss just told you hey this new create-react-app just

03:08.140 --> 03:08.830
got published.

03:08.830 --> 03:09.780
It's a lot faster.

03:09.780 --> 03:11.010
It's more performant.

03:11.020 --> 03:14.920
It uses a lot of the upgraded tools can we upgraded.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.570
What do you do.

03:16.570 --> 03:25.140
Well all you need to do is if we open this project up and Sublime Text we would go to package.json

03:25.160 --> 03:29.840
and see over here how our version is 1.0.

03:31.490 --> 03:39.910
And we know that the version the newest version is 2.1.1 well all we need to do is

03:40.030 --> 03:42.240
just update the.

03:42.320 --> 03:51.430
And then run npm install and that's going to read the package.json file and re-install everything

03:51.460 --> 04:00.350
using react scripts with a version 2.0 1.1 which will update everything for us.

04:00.360 --> 04:10.140
We now have the latest version of reactor and all we need to do to check that it's working is run 

04:10.150 --> 04:11.260
npm start again.

04:13.690 --> 04:19.240
And our robofriends app which we're going to build over the next couple of videos seems to be still

04:19.240 --> 04:20.160
working.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.550
Very nice.

04:22.980 --> 04:28.640
And by the way as a side note you can update to react to the newer versions as well.

04:28.650 --> 04:36.570
If you want to go over here we see that the latest reac version is sixteen point six point one.

04:36.730 --> 04:44.050
So we could do the same here and update the library but that's something that we don't really need to

04:44.050 --> 04:45.040
do now.

04:45.120 --> 04:51.830
Now usually when you're working with large projects this can get pretty tough when we're updating libraries.

04:51.850 --> 04:57.430
We might have breaking changes that as we update might break our app and if our app is really really

04:57.430 --> 05:03.540
big you might not even notice that these updates to a library is going to affect our app.

05:03.550 --> 05:05.010
Maybe you will discover that bug.

05:05.080 --> 05:09.860
Four months from now after we've done the update and that's something that you really want to be careful

05:09.860 --> 05:13.100
of and think about in your career as a developer.

05:13.470 --> 05:20.440
It's why package.json files exist because this way I can copy this package.json file and give

05:20.440 --> 05:28.450
it to another developer and this developer knows exactly what version of libraries and packages they

05:28.450 --> 05:32.700
should use in order to make sure that this project runs.

05:32.880 --> 05:40.080
It's good to update your libraries but it's not necessarily always the best way to do things because

05:40.590 --> 05:46.680
you might have those rare cases when bugs emerge and that's something that you'll just have to get used

05:46.680 --> 05:50.450
to and adapt as you get more and more experience.

05:50.460 --> 05:53.800
All right let's get started in the next video Buh-Bye.
