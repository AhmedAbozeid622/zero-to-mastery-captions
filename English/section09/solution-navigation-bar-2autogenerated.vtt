Come back in the last video we had this problem of the view getting a little bit ugly with our navigation

00:07.780 --> 00:10.630
as we became smaller and smaller with our viewport.

00:10.930 --> 00:12.100
How can we fix this.

00:13.370 --> 00:20.030
And here I'm going to show you a topic that actually cover in my next course but just because it might

00:20.030 --> 00:27.550
be useful for this case I'm going to introduce you to something called Media QUIERES and media queries

00:27.670 --> 00:34.990
allow us to create Responsive Web sites and tell our web pages what to do when the size of our screen

00:34.990 --> 00:37.020
gets small or big.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.870
And a link to this Web site over here.

00:39.910 --> 00:48.100
But essentially what it allows us to do with media queries we can have devices tablets laptops wearables

00:48.100 --> 00:54.920
that have different screen sizes and tell it how to display our web page based on those sizes.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.040
For example here it shows us what our view points will be for iPhone 4 and iPhone for us and using this

01:03.190 --> 01:13.330
syntax of at media only screen and giving it some minimum device with and Nax device with.

01:13.540 --> 01:22.360
We can tell it how to display our page or have CSSA properties specific to just this view size that

01:22.360 --> 01:29.360
is minimum view size is going to be 320 pixel and Nax is 480 pixels.

01:29.510 --> 01:35.530
And as you can imagine there is a lot of these based on different devices and viewpoints.

01:35.790 --> 01:41.960
Now things like CSSA great and flex box actually resolve a lot of this but I want to demonstrate just

01:41.960 --> 01:50.670
one use case with our little example that is this contact's getting smushed.

01:50.730 --> 01:56.480
So let's create our own media query for our navigation in order to do that.

01:56.490 --> 02:04.690
All we need to do is say at media we say on the screen and this is saying what do we want our media

02:04.720 --> 02:05.600
query for.

02:05.680 --> 02:11.110
And you can do things like print here for example when you're printing something but 99 percent of the

02:11.110 --> 02:13.070
time you're just going to have script.

02:13.570 --> 02:25.420
And here we're going to say and we'll say that max width is going to be 600 pixels that is use this

02:25.480 --> 02:34.240
CSSA properties that we're about to define right here only when Max with its 600 pixel that is as soon

02:34.240 --> 02:36.880
as this is less than 600 pixel.

02:36.910 --> 02:46.850
And with I apply these properties here so I'll say main nav will have a font size.

02:46.890 --> 02:52.980
We can do different things here but let's just say a smaller font size and maybe will do padding of

02:52.980 --> 02:55.800
zero just so they're closer together.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.790
Fight save this and refresh.

02:59.860 --> 03:00.720
Look at that.

03:01.060 --> 03:06.400
Everything fits in because our font size is smaller and we've removed any extra padding that we may

03:06.400 --> 03:07.320
have.

03:07.500 --> 03:17.510
But notice here as I make things bigger you see that as soon as they pass 600 pixels we restore our

03:17.510 --> 03:23.450
defaults with larger font size like that.

03:23.820 --> 03:28.810
So using media queries we just made our nav bar more responsive.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.410
Nice and easy.

03:32.740 --> 03:40.690
And this is a common pattern that I recommend with your navigation that is having our NAV element with

03:40.810 --> 03:43.660
an unordered list and an ally list.

03:44.780 --> 03:52.880
Our main nav which will be a flex box and we'll have a push class that uses this margin left.

03:52.880 --> 03:53.390
Auto.

03:53.420 --> 03:57.640
To push whatever we want to our NAV to the right side.

03:57.650 --> 04:02.760
Usually something like contact or log in to have it all the way to the right.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.900
So hopefully this wasn't too bad.

04:04.910 --> 04:07.690
Like I said you don't need to memorize this.

04:07.700 --> 04:13.610
You can even copy the code that I'll leave for you at the end of these videos once you get used to this

04:13.610 --> 04:18.620
syntax you now have a solid foundation to build the navigation.

04:18.620 --> 04:22.010
But we have three more things to go so let's get to that in the next video.
