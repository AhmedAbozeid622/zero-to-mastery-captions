Welcome back when it comes to lay out using CSX a very important skill of a developer there are probably

00:10.090 --> 00:13.560
three really good ways to do it this year.

00:14.710 --> 00:20.640
One is something that we've discussed and that is flex.

00:20.680 --> 00:27.550
Another one was Booth's shop four and we're going to learn about a new way of doing it which is called

00:27.790 --> 00:37.670
CSSA grid and if you go for a google image search and type in something like CSX flex box versus grid

00:38.000 --> 00:43.460
you're going to get a lot of images explaining what the differences are why you use one over the other.

00:43.460 --> 00:50.630
But I want to just press face the next couple of videos and let you know that there's no one versus

00:50.630 --> 00:52.920
the other one that wins out over the other.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.710
There's always a tradeoff.

00:54.950 --> 01:02.660
And the best way to think about these tools is as complimentary tools that is the both work really really

01:02.660 --> 01:03.730
well together.

01:03.770 --> 01:11.510
You don't only have to use just fluxbox or just see a set script ideally use them both together and

01:11.510 --> 01:18.680
I'll show you later on how we can use both fluxbox and CSSA grid to pretty much do anything we want.

01:18.680 --> 01:26.030
When it comes to layout but just to start us off a good way to think about fluxbox versus see SS grid

01:27.810 --> 01:32.700
is that Fluxbox is really good to use if you just have one demential.

01:32.850 --> 01:39.400
Maybe you're only thinking about columns and how to do layout based on columns.

01:39.620 --> 01:47.610
Says grids are really really powerful especially when it comes to two dimensional layouts that is both

01:47.910 --> 01:49.870
columns and rows.

01:50.070 --> 01:57.270
So it's really really good at let's say image galleries or listing out your portfolio projects on your

01:57.270 --> 02:00.960
own personal web page and we'll get into that.

02:01.080 --> 02:08.210
But now you might be asking yourself OK isn't this what bootstrap allows us to do.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.690
And you'd be right.

02:10.950 --> 02:16.630
Bootstrap came at a time when we didn't have flex Xbox and CSSA grit.

02:16.710 --> 02:25.620
It came at a time when we just had display and floats and positioning CSSA properties that as we saw

02:25.620 --> 02:31.740
are really really difficult to use when it comes to layouts and bootstrap solved that problem.

02:31.740 --> 02:37.040
It gave us this grid system that we can use within bootstrap to make really beautiful layouts.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.290
So that was really really useful.

02:40.560 --> 02:47.850
But on your resume if you say that you know bootstrapped for yeah that's good but it won't be that impressive

02:48.270 --> 02:55.950
to employers any more especially if you're going for a real developer job which is why I haven't focused

02:55.950 --> 03:02.940
too much on bootstrap it because I argue that everything they can do and bootstrap for although sometimes

03:02.940 --> 03:09.990
it's easy because it comes with their own pre-built components you can do now using flex blocks and

03:09.990 --> 03:16.320
see a set script and because being a good developer means not just learning one library that always

03:16.320 --> 03:17.610
changes always evolves.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.190
It's learning the fundamentals.

03:20.330 --> 03:26.960
It's more important for us to learn fluxbox and CSSA grid because now if we know these two we can create

03:27.050 --> 03:29.360
any sort of layout we want.

03:29.360 --> 03:34.910
One last thing when it comes to CSSA grid it's a new feature.

03:34.910 --> 03:40.910
Most web browsers have support for it but we do see a few reds and older versions of browsers that do

03:40.910 --> 03:43.400
not support CSSA grid.

03:43.790 --> 03:51.800
When we look at flex box it's a little bit better because it's older than CSSA script and we've learned

03:51.800 --> 03:53.480
all about this before right.

03:53.510 --> 03:59.970
Each browser has their own implementation and any new feature has to be implemented individually.

03:59.980 --> 04:07.820
So although US grid has become pretty standard across the web if you're trying to support older browsers

04:07.910 --> 04:13.980
or something like Opera Mini then you might want to consider using floats to do layout.

04:14.330 --> 04:19.430
Although to be honest most of the voice AB is moving toward CSSA grid and fluxbox.

04:19.460 --> 04:26.390
So I just recommend starting to use this right away because eventually this will have really really

04:26.390 --> 04:28.750
good support but enough talk.

04:28.910 --> 04:34.670
I think it's time for us to learn CSSA grid's to see what all the hype is about and start working on

04:34.670 --> 04:36.320
a fun little project.

04:37.090 --> 04:38.900
I'll see in the next one but by.
