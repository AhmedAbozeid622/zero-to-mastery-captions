00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.970
Welcome back!

00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:05.273
In this section I want to
tackle the problem that we have

00:00:05.297 --> 00:00:06.969
especially when we're starting out

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.309
that is "How do I create
a layout of a website?".

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.450
And it's probably the hardest thing
to learn when you're starting off.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.210
How do you create something let's
say like this that is responsive that

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.734
we see all across the web.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.490
A navigation bar, a header,
some grids, a footer down here.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.610
And how do we really make it responsive?

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.820
In this section we're going to
build an ideal webpage layout.

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:47.244
So that moving forward you
have the baseline and fondation

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.959
to go off and customize and build whatever
sites you want that are responsive without

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.740
spending a lot of time trial and error trying
different things with CSS hoping that it works.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.740
So I'm going to show you my
recommended way of laying out web pages

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:07.640
that is responsive and have that
template available to you moving forward.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.730
We're also going to learn about a
new feature in CSS called CSS grid

00:01:13.954 --> 00:01:16.254
which is a really really powerful.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.150
And as you learn allows us to use
this CSS grid combined with flexbox

00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:27.074
to honestly not even need
things like Bootstrap 4

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.170
or other libraries that
allow you to do grids.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.130
Back in the day, it was really
really hard to do layout and in CSS.

00:01:35.154 --> 00:01:39.954
But with tools like CSS
grid and flexbox you now

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.230
have the ability to really build beautiful
responsive layouts really really fast.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.819
So let's get started.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.230
See you in the next video.
