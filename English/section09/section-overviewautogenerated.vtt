Welcome back in this section I want to tackle the problem that we have especially when we're starting

00:06.970 --> 00:12.310
out there is how do I create a layout of a Web site.

00:12.310 --> 00:17.450
And it's probably the hardest thing to learn when you're starting off.

00:17.640 --> 00:24.810
How do you create something let's say like this that is responsive that we see all across the web and

00:24.810 --> 00:30.490
navigation bar a hatter some grids a footer down here.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.610
And how do we really make it responsive.

00:37.720 --> 00:45.820
In this section we're going to build an ideal web page layout so that moving forward you have the baseline

00:45.820 --> 00:52.960
and Fondation to go off and customize and build whatever sites you want that are responsive without

00:52.960 --> 00:58.740
spending a lot of time trial and error trying different things with CSSA hoping that it works.

00:58.750 --> 01:05.440
So I'm going to show you my recommended way of laying out web pages that is responsive and have that

01:05.440 --> 01:07.640
template available to you moving forward.

01:08.380 --> 01:16.230
We're also going to learn about a new feature in CSSA called CSSA grid which is a really really powerful.

01:16.270 --> 01:25.850
And as you learn allows us to use this CSSA grid combined with fluxbox to honestly Navan need things

01:25.850 --> 01:32.270
like bootstrap four or other libraries that allow you to do grids back in the day.

01:32.270 --> 01:40.130
It was really really hard to do layout and see SS But with tools like CSSA grid and flex box you now

01:40.130 --> 01:47.230
have the ability to really build beautiful responsive layouts really really fast.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.820
So let's get started.

01:48.820 --> 01:50.230
See you in the next video.
