WEBVTT

00:00.910 --> 00:02.040
Welcome back.

00:02.080 --> 00:05.470
Now that we have our navigation let's focus on our cover.

00:06.480 --> 00:14.690
If we go back to our a simple page we have our cover here and we can just keep the date here as it is

00:14.840 --> 00:20.810
because we don't really know what the cover will be just yet but I want to add a new CSSA class called

00:20.990 --> 00:21.920
container here.

00:23.040 --> 00:29.160
And this container is going to define some properties for us that will make this truly a cover image

00:29.160 --> 00:33.420
just like we have in our solution web page over here.

00:34.690 --> 00:41.790
And let's add those exclamation marks because we're excited not for conduct's for the cover.

00:41.940 --> 00:44.360
That's the exclamation marks are here.

00:44.380 --> 00:45.010
Nice.

00:45.890 --> 00:46.480
All right.

00:46.700 --> 00:55.910
We'll go to our style Dotsie SS and we'll add on our cover style NOW.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.030
This is actually going to be fairly easy.

01:02.060 --> 01:10.020
We want to have let's say display of flax or first of all let's make sure that we have the container

01:10.020 --> 01:17.810
class and we'll have a display of flex and I'm now using grid here because well we're not going to have

01:17.810 --> 01:23.510
any grid items we won't have that many items in a cover it's usually a button or a background image

01:23.510 --> 01:28.370
or some text and display flex just makes things nice and simple.

01:28.480 --> 01:35.380
And usually we want things in the cover to be centered that is we want this cover to be right in the

01:35.380 --> 01:36.000
center.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.870
And as we make things smaller it's always going to be in the center.

01:39.970 --> 01:44.280
That's something that we see a lot of in a lot of Web sites.

01:44.710 --> 01:48.220
And to do that especially with Fluxbox is really easy.

01:48.220 --> 01:57.990
All we need to say is to align items center and to justify content center just like that.

01:58.210 --> 02:03.280
If I save here and refresh All right this is centered.

02:03.520 --> 02:12.250
And as I move things perfect everything is absolutely centered but obviously cover image should be a

02:12.250 --> 02:13.900
little bit larger rate.

02:13.900 --> 02:14.980
What do we do here.

02:15.850 --> 02:19.900
And I want to introduce to you something that you haven't seen before but don't get scared.

02:19.900 --> 02:20.820
It's not that hard.

02:21.870 --> 02:27.780
I'm going to have a height and just to start us off I'm going to show you usually you might do something

02:27.780 --> 02:30.620
like 500 pixels and if I refresh.

02:30.690 --> 02:31.240
Awesome.

02:31.530 --> 02:36.860
I have a nice little height but there's a problem here right.

02:36.980 --> 02:45.080
Because I'm saying 500 pixel here if the viewport if I move things around if I lift things up you'll

02:45.080 --> 02:53.910
see that all right the view is not responsive when I go up because it's always find find your pixels.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.650
And this might not be the worst idea ever.

02:56.650 --> 02:58.600
Maybe you want your website to be like that.

02:58.870 --> 03:06.970
But if you do want this to be responsive in terms of going up and down as well what we can do is use

03:06.970 --> 03:16.970
something called the H that is the viewport height and I like using viewport height a new unit that

03:16.970 --> 03:21.270
we haven't seen before for making things responsive when it comes to height.

03:21.530 --> 03:29.570
And what this states it's going to look at the viewport that is the view of the web page and make sure

03:29.570 --> 03:34.690
that there's always a percentage of that viewport dedicated to this container.

03:34.700 --> 03:47.720
So if I do 50 VH and if I refresh your you'll see that might cover will be 50 percent of our viewport.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.360
If I do 100 and I refresh

03:54.690 --> 03:59.810
you see that the cover fills up the entire viewport.

03:59.880 --> 04:09.270
The cool part is if I go up and down this adjusts exactly according to the viewport height that is the

04:09.270 --> 04:10.560
window of the browser.

04:11.800 --> 04:12.700
Very cool right.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.040
And everything is still centered.

04:15.220 --> 04:19.560
So I like using the VH 4 or something like a container.

04:19.630 --> 04:26.820
So let's keep it at 50 and if I refresh look at that nice and responsive.

04:26.890 --> 04:27.910
How cool is that.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.140
And that's it for the cover.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.280
Not that hard right.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.400
Let's move on to the project grid in the next video by.
