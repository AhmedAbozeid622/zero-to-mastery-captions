Welcome back now up to this point we learned about a shemale SS templates and learned how to do layout

00:10.100 --> 00:16.430
with things like flex box and CSSA grit and probably the most important thing that you need to know

00:16.430 --> 00:23.240
from these sections is how to create a website right how to lay out a website but also not spend a lot

00:23.240 --> 00:30.860
of time on simple tasks because when we get to the javascript section which is the more exciting actual

00:30.860 --> 00:35.120
logic programming part of the Course that's when you truly become a developer.

00:35.300 --> 00:41.390
Up until now with what we've learned is the foundation that that allows us to build web apps and applications

00:41.900 --> 00:48.820
but you're never going to actually get interviewed about these specific topics.

00:48.830 --> 00:55.390
I mean yes in small cases you might be if you're a designer you might get asked questions about CSSA

00:55.560 --> 00:56.040
him.

00:56.210 --> 01:03.110
But most of the time the questions you'll be asked is on things like javascript logic and more complex

01:03.110 --> 01:05.490
topics that we're going to cover later on in the course.

01:05.600 --> 01:12.320
But the one thing that I really want to take away from this section is being able to build web sites

01:12.440 --> 01:18.710
fast or at least get to the part where you need to start writing javascript because that's where your

01:18.710 --> 01:20.240
real job begins.

01:20.240 --> 01:24.730
So I have a task for you using all the skills that you've learned.

01:24.730 --> 01:31.000
Up until now I wanted to do create a layout of a Web site something that you're going to do over and

01:31.000 --> 01:32.400
over throughout your career.

01:32.770 --> 01:41.330
And I've created a small start to file here where we have these little Bawden like containers or divs.

01:41.590 --> 01:49.450
But as the name suggests I want you to align these in a responsive way to something that looks like

01:49.450 --> 01:51.100
this.

01:51.140 --> 01:56.270
I know it's not the prettiest thing right now to look at and we're only focusing on layout but what

01:56.270 --> 02:03.720
I want you to do is to make the header green button over here be an actual Hetter.

02:03.880 --> 02:10.390
We want the cover to be well the actual cover of our site and then maybe have a project grid where we

02:10.390 --> 02:17.780
list all of our projects like we have over here and then obviously a footer at the bottom and I've selected

02:17.780 --> 02:22.160
this lay out because it's a very common pattern that you'll see in a lot of Web sites so you're going

02:22.160 --> 02:23.330
to be doing this a lot.

02:23.600 --> 02:35.870
So let's figure out the best way to go about doing this so that when I make this smaller it's all responsive.

02:35.910 --> 02:42.960
So your task is to use whatever you've learned up until now to create this using the starter files and

02:42.960 --> 02:46.830
don't worry I'll have a solution video for you after this.

02:46.830 --> 02:52.110
And we'll also go into how easy it is once you have a layout which is the recommended way to build a

02:52.110 --> 02:58.810
Web site starting with the layout first and then once you have the layout fixed converting this into

02:58.810 --> 03:05.590
something usable like this because styling becomes really really easy wants to have the layout in place.

03:06.250 --> 03:14.590
Now the one hint that I want to give here is to use both flex box and CSSA grid to accomplish your goal

03:15.130 --> 03:18.000
although anything you can do in fluxbox.

03:18.100 --> 03:24.490
You can do with grid and vice versa or at least most things using the tools in combination flex box

03:24.550 --> 03:31.220
and see excuss grid together is really really powerful to allow you to build a layout like this.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.080
So good luck.

03:32.080 --> 03:36.420
I know it's going to be tough but I'll see you in the solution video.

03:36.520 --> 03:36.750
Bubba.
