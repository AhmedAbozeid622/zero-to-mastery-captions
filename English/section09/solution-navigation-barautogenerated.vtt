00:01.470 --> 00:02.610
Welcome back.

00:02.610 --> 00:06.320
How is the exercise hopefully wasn't too difficult.

00:06.720 --> 00:10.230
But if it was and you weren't able to finish it.

00:10.380 --> 00:17.190
Don't worry we're going to go over the steps and luckily for you once we do this you'll have a template

00:17.190 --> 00:23.040
that you can use for all your websites because what will build will be something responsive that you

00:23.040 --> 00:30.090
can customize to your own liking but you least know the best practices after this video of how to do

00:30.090 --> 00:34.000
these common patterns that we see in a lot of Web sites.

00:34.050 --> 00:36.030
So let's get started.

00:36.060 --> 00:41.110
The first thing I want to do to convert this page is well a few things.

00:41.130 --> 00:49.590
Let's go to the e-mail page first and let's start off with the navigation that is the header over here.

00:49.590 --> 00:52.960
A lot of Web sites have some sort of a header at the top.

00:52.980 --> 00:59.720
The first thing I want to do is to actually use semantic HTML and be more descriptive in what are doing.

00:59.940 --> 01:06.060
So in our case instead of Dave I'm going to use the nav Ishimaru element and this is something that

01:06.060 --> 01:16.340
we've already talked about and instead of just having Hetter here I'm going to have a UL class or UL

01:16.370 --> 01:20.780
element that will have a class name of Main

01:23.770 --> 01:34.590
and in here we can just have ally elements that will have an anchor tag and because we don't really

01:34.590 --> 01:41.040
have we won't have any links for this example we can obviously do whatever new shemale page that we

01:41.040 --> 01:44.120
want to reference but for now we can just leave it blank.

01:44.610 --> 01:51.720
So the first one will just say be about and we can copy and paste this for the other items as well.

01:53.670 --> 02:02.480
We'll have let's just say products will say our team.

02:02.610 --> 02:10.890
And then finally we'll have contact if I saved this and refresh.

02:11.070 --> 02:15.510
There is our navigation doesn't look very good does it in real life.

02:15.520 --> 02:23.110
Most of the time we see the navigation at the top and sometimes we also see that there's navigation

02:23.110 --> 02:27.250
links at the top and one all the way to the right that's pushed to the right edge.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.540
Such as contacts.

02:29.560 --> 02:35.710
So let's try and do that where we have about products in our team at the top over here and then contacts

02:35.770 --> 02:38.500
all the way to the right at the very edge.

02:38.980 --> 02:45.580
So for that we can create a new class at the very last item that we want to let's say push and we'll

02:45.580 --> 02:47.540
add the CSSA classes.

02:47.540 --> 02:58.930
Now if I go to our let's say this first if I go to style see SS We can create our navigation here now.

03:03.060 --> 03:10.060
We have the main nav class which we've created and in here we want to use fluxbox.

03:10.080 --> 03:17.660
So I'm going to say display flex to activate flex box sounds cool when I say activate fluxbox.

03:18.180 --> 03:26.130
I want to make sure I remove these little dots in front of the names so I can just say the list style

03:26.340 --> 03:30.010
none which will remove these little pointers.

03:30.240 --> 03:37.250
And let's say that we want the font size to be let's say 0.7.

03:37.320 --> 03:37.980
Yeah.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.840
Fi save and refresh your.

03:41.930 --> 03:47.360
All right things are a little bit better but still not perfect.

03:47.390 --> 03:50.000
One is we want to remove any margins.

03:50.120 --> 03:54.480
So I'm going to say Marjan 0.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.510
If I refresh.

03:56.750 --> 04:03.380
All right we've removed some margins but still not pretty we want to perhaps at some spaces in between

04:03.380 --> 04:11.410
these things I'm going to just have the class which is our navigation items and I'll just say that we

04:11.410 --> 04:15.440
want the padding to be 20 pixels I refresh.

04:15.700 --> 04:16.760
That's a lot better.

04:16.890 --> 04:17.450
OK.

04:18.380 --> 04:21.680
And just to clean things up let's say that our anchor tags.

04:21.740 --> 04:36.070
We also want them to be able to have a color of let's just use five five six five refresh it's nice

04:36.070 --> 04:38.100
and whitish that looks good.

04:38.470 --> 04:46.480
And we don't want those underline so I'm going to say text decoration not refresh.

04:46.490 --> 04:53.810
All good now because I want to start structuring this as a actual web page.

04:53.870 --> 05:01.430
I'm going to go to our zone class and just remove our padding and margin because we don't really need

05:01.430 --> 05:02.370
it.

05:02.410 --> 05:08.670
Refresh your things they're going to start looking ugly but at least we've moved all this whitespace

05:09.600 --> 05:12.520
and then finally our display.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.920
We're no longer going to use inline block.

05:15.210 --> 05:18.560
We want to start using our flex box or CSSA grid.

05:18.570 --> 05:25.190
In our case our main nav is going to have flex display so we don't need our in line block anymore.

05:25.230 --> 05:27.380
We're going to save and refresh.

05:27.390 --> 05:35.640
And that's a lot better because devs are automatically blocked our displays for these bottom ones are

05:35.640 --> 05:37.410
now going to just be blocks.

05:37.500 --> 05:46.490
But our top one our NAV bar has flex now which is great but you'll notice here we have a bit of a white

05:47.000 --> 05:51.410
gap and this is very common when you're working with the SS.

05:51.640 --> 05:56.340
Sometimes browsers by default have some sort of CSSA attached to them.

05:57.190 --> 06:08.040
In this case in Google Chrome our body aliment already has some predefined CSSA classes that are pre-built

06:08.670 --> 06:14.220
by chrome so we can actually remove those and make sure that our margins are zero.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.670
By saying margin.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.640
Auto zero.

06:18.690 --> 06:20.900
And this is something I'll make sure I spell that right.

06:20.910 --> 06:26.580
This is something that you'll see a lot of and you'll do a lot of when it comes to just making sure

06:26.580 --> 06:29.890
that the styles are at least the margins are correct.

06:29.910 --> 06:36.060
When you start off sort of high refresh your look at that margins are on and everything just filled

06:36.060 --> 06:38.630
on the page which is great.

06:38.650 --> 06:46.150
The last thing I want to do is to move contacts all the way up to the right and remember the push class

06:46.270 --> 06:47.130
that we added.

06:47.350 --> 06:50.360
Well that's going to be super easy to do.

06:50.440 --> 07:05.030
All we need to do is to add a push CSSA class that says margin left to be auto and with this auto if

07:05.030 --> 07:10.190
I refresh contact's goes all the way to the right.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.030
If I inspect this element.

07:12.070 --> 07:19.550
So I just right click and click on inspect and let's make this a little bit bigger so we can see if

07:19.550 --> 07:22.250
I hover over ally push here.

07:23.460 --> 07:30.420
We see that each element has its own box but because we did margin left.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.490
Auto our ally element.

07:33.490 --> 07:39.300
It's going to get automatically push because it has this automatic margin that it creates to the very

07:39.300 --> 07:39.830
end.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.540
If I did Marjane right for example and I refresh your

07:46.870 --> 07:52.800
margin would now actually be all the way to the right to fill up the entire width of the viewport.

07:54.690 --> 07:56.900
But let's go back to left.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.550
Let's go back to the left save and refresh here.

08:00.590 --> 08:03.950
The neat part about this is that with this margin left.

08:03.950 --> 08:13.080
Auto I can now resize our page and you'll see that contact's is always going to be to our right.

08:13.100 --> 08:17.960
This is something that you'll see in a lot of Web sites and we did that fairly fast.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.550
Not too bad right.

08:19.610 --> 08:27.320
The last thing I want to fix here is as you'll notice as we get closer and closer it kind of overlaps

08:27.320 --> 08:28.140
our team.

08:28.160 --> 08:33.650
And well now we have this weird little contacts that overflows.

08:33.710 --> 08:35.350
How can we fix this.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.940
Let's tackle that in the next video.
