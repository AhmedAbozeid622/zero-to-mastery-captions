WEBVTT

00:01.010 --> 00:02.140
Welcome back.

00:02.160 --> 00:08.630
Well let's take just five minutes to quickly make this Web site a little bit prettier just to show you

00:08.630 --> 00:11.490
how easy it is to customize a site.

00:11.540 --> 00:17.480
Once you have the layout done a recommended step that I've mentioned multiple times when you build a

00:17.480 --> 00:21.110
web site figure out your layout make it responsive.

00:21.110 --> 00:23.920
And once that's done the rest is kind of fun.

00:23.990 --> 00:29.510
You just add nice CSSA properties some images to just pretty fly.

00:29.630 --> 00:37.430
So in our case I want to show you a Web site called well no shared dot X Y Z and it's going to really

00:37.430 --> 00:47.240
help you out because it gives you free design resources to use and they have font's illustrations mockups

00:47.510 --> 00:51.390
UI kits everything for free that you can use on your website.

00:51.410 --> 00:55.460
In our case we can use something like On draw over here.

00:55.460 --> 01:02.390
That gives us a ton of MIT Illustrated or licensed illustrations.

01:02.420 --> 01:10.210
So if I go to browse now we see that we have a ton of images that we can use so in my case I've downloaded

01:10.210 --> 01:16.190
one of these images and we're going to use it as our cover photo.

01:16.300 --> 01:24.850
So let's go back to our project and in my cover photo over here instead of just having cover with exclamation

01:24.850 --> 01:34.630
marks I'll just have an image tag that will have a class of cover a CSSA property that we're going to

01:35.050 --> 01:42.660
see a SS class that will use and is going to link to the image that I just downloaded in my images folder.

01:43.430 --> 01:47.900
Again the shoe already be in your starter file that I gave to you.

01:47.900 --> 01:54.190
So if you're looking at a folder you'll see that we have an image folder and from there we're going

01:54.190 --> 01:56.040
to grab the on draw.

01:56.050 --> 01:56.370
Scott

01:59.720 --> 02:08.670
I save this and refresh it and make sure I finish that half with an ending bracket and I refresh.

02:08.850 --> 02:10.060
And this is that PMG.

02:10.140 --> 02:11.250
Let's refresh.

02:11.670 --> 02:12.900
That's a lot better.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.330
But boy that's a big image.

02:15.330 --> 02:25.700
We can easily fix this by going to our small going to our cover and using the cover class that we've

02:25.700 --> 02:29.750
added to the image to just say that we want the width to be.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.650
Well we can say 100 percent that but that might be too big.

02:33.800 --> 02:34.820
I don't like it that big.

02:34.970 --> 02:43.290
Let's do 30 YEM five refresh for R.E.M. refresh.

02:43.350 --> 02:44.280
That's better.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.280
But we want to get rid of this red background now.

02:47.310 --> 02:49.560
Let's have everything in white.

02:49.600 --> 02:57.340
She going to go up to our zone and we can just actually remove the red from here.

02:58.480 --> 03:03.290
I refresh much better it looks a lot better.

03:03.290 --> 03:04.180
All right.

03:04.370 --> 03:13.880
So as we see the image sizes and growing which is good but it looks nice and pretty as the cover photo.

03:13.880 --> 03:19.880
Another thing that I noticed is that when I scroll down I want the header tab to be sticky that is to

03:19.880 --> 03:26.210
scroll with me and that's another common pattern that we'll see that's fairly easy to do.

03:27.110 --> 03:35.660
We can just give the nav element a sticky class and this sticky class

03:39.900 --> 03:51.410
can say that people have a position of fixed and a top of 0 that is starting to talk.

03:51.450 --> 03:57.740
And if I refresh this it will actually because of the position fixed although it works now.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.500
It messed up our with.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.150
So we want to make sure that the with is always 100 percent.

04:03.150 --> 04:12.000
So all we would do is at the end say with 100 percent again these three properties together is a common

04:12.300 --> 04:20.320
pattern that you'll see to make to make navigation sticky so that now when I scroll down look at that

04:20.440 --> 04:24.050
our navigation is nice and sticky.

04:24.280 --> 04:27.700
Let's make the green navigation bar blue.

04:28.150 --> 04:32.440
So I'll turn this into blue all right that looks a lot better.

04:34.040 --> 04:47.410
What else we can change our font let's say to something prettier font family just say Ariel fyrir fresh.

04:47.410 --> 04:47.640
All right.

04:47.650 --> 04:50.250
That looks a little bit cleaner.

04:50.260 --> 04:51.690
What else can we do here.

04:53.090 --> 04:58.900
Well just to finish it off maybe we want to do something different when we hover over the zone.

04:58.940 --> 05:05.880
Let's say that with the boxes when we hover over them I can just copy and paste this.

05:05.980 --> 05:07.900
Let's make them tilt a little bit.

05:07.960 --> 05:15.470
So I'll say box and instead of shadow or box shadow will say transform

05:22.710 --> 05:29.840
and we'll just say that we want to rotate say negative 7 degrees

05:37.280 --> 05:39.850
safe and refresh.

05:39.850 --> 05:41.010
Look at that.

05:41.260 --> 05:46.230
We have some grid systems that when we hover over them they rotate 7 degrees.

05:46.510 --> 05:54.550
I mean I want to demonstrate to you how fast we can convert a website to start looking good by no means

05:54.550 --> 06:08.040
is this perfect but by just changing a few properties we've now gone from this to our final view and

06:08.040 --> 06:16.260
you can imagine how within a day of improving this Web site making this a little bit prettier Maybe

06:16.290 --> 06:27.220
you really like this Web site cards that they have here so you can just inspect the element and perhaps

06:27.220 --> 06:32.600
just copy their CSSA styles.

06:32.770 --> 06:34.930
But there's a lot of flexibility here.

06:35.570 --> 06:43.490
The important point though is the fact that you start with your layout using flex blocks and CSSA grid

06:44.560 --> 06:51.170
and then it's really up to you and your creativity to design beautiful Web sites.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.830
I hope that was fun.

06:52.860 --> 06:59.260
I definitely had a lot of fun playing with CSSA great and fluxbox and I'll see you in the next video.
