00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.140
Welcome back!

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.629
Well let's take just five minutes to quickly make
this website a little bit prettier just to show you

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.490
how easy it is to customize a website.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.479
Once you have the layout done a recommended step
that I've mentioned multiple times when you build a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.109
web site figure out your
layout make it responsive.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.920
And once that's done
the rest is kind of fun.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.510
You just add nice CSS properties
some images to just prettify.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.429
So in our case I want to show you a website
called well noshit.xyz and it's going to really

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:47.240
help you out because it gives you free design resources
to use and they have font's illustrations mockups

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.390
UI kits everything for free that
you can use on your website.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.459
In our case we can use
something like undraw over here.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.390
That gives us a ton of MIT
illustrated or licensed illustrations.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.209
So if I go to browse now we see that we have a ton of
images that we can use so in my case I've downloaded

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.190
one of these images and we're
going to use it as our cover photo.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.849
So let's go back to our project and in my cover photo
over here instead of just having cover with exclamation

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:34.630
marks I'll just have an image tag that will have a
class of cover a CSS property that we're going to

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.660
or CSS class that will use and is going to link to the
image that I just downloaded in my images folder.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.899
Again the should already be in your
starter file that I gave to you.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.189
So if you're looking at a folder you'll see that
we have an image folder and from there we're going

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.040
to grab the undraw.jpg

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.720
If I save this and refresh. Make sure I finish
that half with an ending bracket and I refresh.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.060
And this is a png.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.250
Let's refresh.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.899
That's a lot better.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.329
But oh boy! That's a big image!

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:25.699
We can easily fix this by going to our style going
to our cover and using the cover class that we've

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.750
added to the image to just say
that we want the width to be.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.650
Well we can say 100 percent
that but that might be too big.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.820
I don't like it that big.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.290
Let's do '30em' If I
refresh or 'rem' refresh.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.280
That's better.

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:47.280
But we want to get rid of
this red background now.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.560
Let's have everything in white.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.340
I should going to go up to our zone and we
can just actually remove the red from here.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.289
If I refresh.
Much better, that looks a lot better.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.290
All right.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:13.879
So as we see the image sizes and growing which is
good but it looks nice and pretty as the cover photo.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.879
Another thing that I noticed is that when I scroll
down I want the header tab to be sticky that is to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.210
scroll with me and that's another common pattern
that we'll see that's fairly easy to do.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:35.660
We can just give the nav element a
sticky class and this sticky class

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:51.410
can say that we'll have a position of
fixed and a top of 0 that is start of top.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.740
And if I refresh this it will actually because
of the position fixed although it works now.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.500
It messed up our width.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.149
So we want to make sure that
the width is always 100 percent.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:12.000
So all we would do is at the end say with 100 percent
again these three properties together is a common

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.320
pattern that you'll see to make to make navigation
sticky so that now when I scroll down look at that

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.050
our navigation is nice and sticky.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.700
Let's make the green navigation bar blue.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.440
So I'll turn this into blue all
right that looks a lot better.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:47.409
What else we can change our font let's say to something
prettier font family let's just say Arial. If I fresh.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.640
All right.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.250
That looks a little bit cleaner.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.690
What else can we do here?

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.900
Well just to finish it off maybe we want to do
something different when we hover over the zone.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.880
Let's say that with the boxes when we hover
over them I can just copy and paste this.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.900
Let's make them tilt a little bit.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:15.470
So I'll say box and instead of shadow
or box-shadow we'll say transform

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:29.840
and we'll just say that we want
to rotate say negative 7 degrees

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.849
If I save and refresh.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.010
Look at that.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.230
We have some grid systems that when we
hover over them they rotate 7 degrees.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:54.549
I mean I want to demonstrate to you how fast we can
convert a website to start looking good by no means

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:08.039
is this perfect but by just changing a few properties
we've now gone from this to our final view and

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:16.260
you can imagine how within a day of improving this
website making this a little bit prettier. Maybe

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:27.219
you really like this website cards that they have
here so you can just inspect the element and perhaps

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.600
just copy their CSS styles.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.930
But there's a lot of flexibility here.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:43.490
The important point though is the fact that you start
with your layout using flexbox and CSS grid

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.170
and then it's really up to you and your
creativity to design beautiful websites.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.830
I hope that was fun.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:59.260
I definitely had a lot of fun playing with CSS grid
and flexbox and I'll see you in the next video.
