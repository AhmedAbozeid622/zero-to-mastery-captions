An other thing I want to show you with the individual item in a grid is that we can do something like

00:09.180 --> 00:12.510
justify self.

00:12.670 --> 00:20.500
Remember here we did justify items and align items but when it comes to individual items we have to

00:20.500 --> 00:21.710
use self.

00:22.180 --> 00:30.920
And as you can imagine if I do self start and I refresh your we go to the start of the column.

00:31.230 --> 00:43.370
If I do a line it's going to go to the start of the row and if we do and and refresh again we see that

00:43.490 --> 00:46.250
the same thing is happening.

00:46.330 --> 00:50.600
I'm going to leave this file for you as well so you can play around with it.

00:50.650 --> 00:58.090
I encourage you to try to create different types of grids and looks that you want as you can see it's

00:58.090 --> 01:05.830
pretty powerful but also very very simple and allows us to create responsive grid systems very very

01:05.830 --> 01:07.120
easily.

01:07.120 --> 01:12.040
Now there's actually a cheat sheet that you can use to summarize everything that I've taught you up

01:12.040 --> 01:15.550
until now there's a link to this video.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.860
It's called The Well the grid.

01:19.510 --> 01:22.850
And it shows you exactly why you need to do for the container.

01:23.730 --> 01:32.370
We've learned about grid gap grid templates line items and also what to do with the children such as

01:32.370 --> 01:39.870
Grid column justify self align self and has all these little snippets that you can just click on and

01:40.110 --> 01:41.650
copy.

01:41.670 --> 01:46.660
So I recommend you play around with some of these properties on your own.

01:47.360 --> 01:54.100
Because in the next part we're going to use CSSA grid to build a complete Web site layout.

01:54.170 --> 01:55.940
I'll see in one way.
