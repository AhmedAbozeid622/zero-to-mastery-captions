00:00.710 --> 00:07.600
And welcome back to the second 'Web-developer Fundamentals'.

00:08.090 --> 00:16.370
Now again, without doing much coding, we've just learned another very important aspect of being a web

00:16.370 --> 00:22.160
developer, something that will take you throughout your career, that you'll need to work with and that

00:22.160 --> 00:26.480
is the fact that we have multiple web browsers.

00:26.900 --> 00:33.860
Now if you remember Tim Berners-Lee the inventor of the worldwide web created it because we needed a

00:33.860 --> 00:42.140
standard way to share documents amongst each other, and through HTML, CSS and Javascript we're able

00:42.140 --> 00:46.710
to read these files and actually have beautiful websites.

00:47.890 --> 00:52.890
Now, when we send these files over - let's make a copy of them.

00:54.110 --> 00:56.900
Each of these browsers read it -

00:56.900 --> 01:02.980
The HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and lay out the web-page for us.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.460
But as you can see each one of them is owned by a company, and is a different browser.

01:09.530 --> 01:17.180
So that means they all have to agree on how they're going to read the HTML, CSS, and Javascript, because

01:17.420 --> 01:25.250
if they don't all agree, then well, we need to create different files specific for each browser, because

01:25.280 --> 01:30.260
each one of them has a different idea of what HTML, CSS, and Javascript is.

01:30.370 --> 01:31.370
And you know what?

01:31.420 --> 01:38.360
When the World Wide Web got started we had something called, 'the browser wars' where each browser was

01:38.360 --> 01:41.450
kind of doing its own thing implementing different things.

01:41.450 --> 01:50.110
And we still have that to this day, to some extent, but there is a governing body which kind of creates

01:50.110 --> 01:59.120
the standards now. But still, it is still a pain point for developers, where we need to figure out that

01:59.180 --> 02:07.700
whenever we send our files to the web browser, it all looks the same. And that is one of the biggest problems

02:07.700 --> 02:13.220
we have as developers and you'll see tools later on in this course that try to solve that issue.

02:13.370 --> 02:18.590
But you'll always encounter this problem, where we want to make sure that wherever your browser gets

02:18.590 --> 02:27.410
rendered, anybody can see your website, and not only that we also have mobile phones now that access

02:27.410 --> 02:27.890
the Internet.

02:27.920 --> 02:28.970
We have iPads.

02:29.270 --> 02:37.820
So now, not only do we have to worry about different browsers, and whether they agree on what code works

02:37.880 --> 02:39.570
in each of these files.

02:39.680 --> 02:45.740
You also have to make sure that our web sites look good on small screens on big screens on all sorts

02:45.740 --> 02:51.710
of different screens, and that is a very important concept something that, when you get to become a web

02:51.710 --> 02:58.610
-developer you'll encounter this problem where you have to test on each device, each browser to make

02:58.610 --> 03:04.160
sure everything works. And we'll use some tools that have developed over the years to solve these problems

03:04.490 --> 03:10.220
so that it's not as much as a pain point as it is or as it was. All right,

03:10.250 --> 03:15.830
one more lesson to go and then we're going to get coding. See you on the other side.
