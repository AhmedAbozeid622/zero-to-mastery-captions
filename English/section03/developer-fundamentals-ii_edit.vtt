00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.960
And welcome back to the second
'Web-developer Fundamentals'.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.599
Another very important aspect
of being a web developer

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.710
and that is the fact that we
have multiple web browsers.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.289
Now if you remember Tim Berners-Lee the inventor of
the worldwide web created it because we needed a

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:28.569
standard way to share documents amongst each other,
and through HTML, CSS and Javascript we're able

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.840
to read these files and actually
have beautiful websites.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.170
Now, when we send these files over

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.580
Each of these browsers

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.560
read the HTML, CSS, and Javascript,
and layout the web-page for us.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.420
But as you can see each one of them is owned
by a company, and is a different browser.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.130
So that means they all have to agree on how they're
going to read the HTML, CSS, and Javascript, because

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.200
if they don't all agree, then well, we need to create
different files specific for each browser, because

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.210
each one of them has a different idea
of what HTML, CSS, and Javascript is.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.320
And you know what?

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.709
When the World Wide Web got started we had something
called, 'the browser wars' where each browser was

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.799
kind of doing its own thing
implementing different things.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.459
And we still have that to this day, to some extent,
there is a governing body which kind of creates

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.270
the standards now. But it is still a pain point
for developers, where we need to figure out that

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:47.349
whenever we send our files to the web browser, it all
looks the same. And that is one of the biggest problems

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.870
we have as developers and you'll see tools later
on in this course that try to solve that issue.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.239
But you'll always encounter this problem, where we
want to make sure that wherever your browser gets

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.059
rendered, anybody can see your website, and not only
that we also have mobile phones now that access

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.540
the Internet.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.620
We have iPads.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.969
So now, not only do we have to worry about different
browsers, and whether they agree on what code works

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.160
in each of these files.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.229
We also have to make sure that our web sites look
good on small screens on big screens on all sorts

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.199
of different screens, and that is a very important
concept something that, when you get to become a web

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.099
-developer you'll encounter this problem where you
have to test on each device, each browser to make

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.650
sure everything works. And we'll use some tools that
have developed over the years to solve these problems

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.710
so that it's not as much as a pain
point as it is or as it was. All right,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.320
one more lesson to go and then we're going
to get coding. See you on the other side.
