00:00.770 --> 00:01.730
Welcome back.

00:01.730 --> 00:07.520
So how are we going to build this from scratch based on what we've learned so far.

00:07.520 --> 00:12.980
Well we're going to use bootstrap for this because we just learned it and actually gave you some starter

00:12.980 --> 00:18.880
files attached to the last lesson if we take a look.

00:18.920 --> 00:19.660
That's right.

00:19.670 --> 00:22.140
We had a header image.

00:22.370 --> 00:30.460
We had an index a shim Alfa and then a style dot CSX file so you can open these make sure they're all

00:30.460 --> 00:31.410
in the same folder.

00:31.420 --> 00:38.080
I called mine start up with an exclamation mark because this is an exciting project and in our case

00:38.080 --> 00:39.870
we'll use Sublime Text.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.260
We should have something like this so we have our index dot asia I'll file our style dot CSX and then

00:49.350 --> 00:51.990
our header image.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.840
Now I filled in a few things for you just to get us started.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.920
Nothing too crazy though.

00:56.950 --> 00:58.180
Don't worry.

00:58.260 --> 01:05.160
One is we've used some Google fonts so that we can use this monster at font which I think is kind of

01:05.160 --> 01:11.520
nice from the Google fonts and we enable that in our style sheet by saying body and HMO.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.630
I want to make sure that the font family has this setting.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.060
If not we'll use sans serif.

01:18.090 --> 01:21.420
I've also set width and height for one hundred percent.

01:21.420 --> 01:27.720
That's always something good to have to make sure that the body and HDMI all cover 100 percent of whatever

01:27.720 --> 01:30.300
we see on the screen.

01:30.390 --> 01:37.880
Next we have our bootstrap CSX from a C.D. and or a content delivery network.

01:38.550 --> 01:44.690
And the reason I've added this year is that so you don't have to actually include a bootstrap file yourself

01:45.770 --> 01:52.770
if I actually go to the bootstrap page and I go to Quasar you'll see that right here we can just copy

01:52.770 --> 01:58.760
and paste this just like here with The Bootstrap CSX file.

01:59.430 --> 02:05.710
So that way right away as soon as we copy and paste this line we have bootstrap available to us.

02:05.790 --> 02:12.490
Now notice here how we have versions of bootstrap in this case has four point three point one.

02:12.510 --> 02:19.440
Now this number as the time passes is going to get bigger and bigger because bootstrap is a constantly

02:19.440 --> 02:22.860
evolving library as developers make updates.

02:23.400 --> 02:28.710
But as long as you use a number higher than this everything in this project should work.

02:28.710 --> 02:34.230
Like I said most of the time no matter when you're watching this video as long as you copy this or you

02:34.230 --> 02:38.820
use my startup files everything should work.

02:38.890 --> 02:41.050
And then finally we have our style sheet.

02:41.140 --> 02:42.170
Nothing new here right.

02:42.190 --> 02:48.250
Because we've already seen this before we have our style dot assess File and our style file just has

02:48.460 --> 02:49.980
this for now.

02:50.120 --> 02:57.560
We also have our header image which again is a nice little laptop image for our startup landing page.

02:57.620 --> 03:03.110
Now this is the Web site over here that is completely blank because we have nothing in the body.

03:03.110 --> 03:08.770
So let's just have a header Wanda says Hulu right here.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.920
Save it and refresh.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.670
Look at that we have.

03:12.940 --> 03:14.270
Hello.

03:14.300 --> 03:21.680
Now notice here how fast I did that I just pressed command are on my laptop which is a Mac.

03:21.700 --> 03:28.700
If you have Windows it's control are to refresh the web page and you notice here that the font is being

03:28.700 --> 03:33.540
applied once again because we have our font family CSX set.

03:34.280 --> 03:42.920
So there's our page our setup and there is what we want to get to now if you want you can go off on

03:42.920 --> 03:47.570
your own and try to attempt to built this from scratch yourself.

03:47.570 --> 03:53.870
Otherwise I'll see you in the next video to actually get our page to look a little bit more like this

03:54.020 --> 03:56.410
and less like this.

03:56.510 --> 03:58.110
I'll see in the next one by.
