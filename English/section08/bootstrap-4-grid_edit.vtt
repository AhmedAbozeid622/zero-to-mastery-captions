WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:02.810
And welcome back.

00:02.920 --> 00:08.110
We left off with our really quick website that we built using Bootstrap.

00:08.260 --> 00:15.190
But I want to show you one thing that I've kept from you and that is the layout feature in Bootstrap.

00:15.200 --> 00:21.410
And this was the primary reason that Bootstrap was so popular because layout was so difficult and

00:21.410 --> 00:23.840
we didn't have flexbox back in the day.

00:23.840 --> 00:32.620
Bootstrap allowed us to create very responsive websites using these ideas of columns. To show you what

00:32.620 --> 00:36.100
I mean we're going to create our own column system.

00:36.300 --> 00:43.200
We're going to go back to our website and I'm going to delete everything that we created so far.

00:44.060 --> 00:47.470
And save and refresh. Everything's empty.

00:47.510 --> 00:50.610
So in Bootstrap you can do something like this.

00:51.910 --> 00:57.300
[div class="container"] You always want to wrap everything in a container and again if you go to the documentation 

00:57.300 --> 01:02.730
it'll show you what to do. And we'll just grab the top ones.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.780
So let's just copy these. Fix the indentation a bit.

01:07.780 --> 01:08.860
There you go.

01:08.940 --> 01:10.450
And if I refresh.

01:10.680 --> 01:14.880
Well we need to have a bit of background so we can see them. So I'm going to say column '.col'

01:17.670 --> 01:30.090
we'll do 'background-color: grey;' and the 'border' will be '2px solid black;' save

01:30.140 --> 01:32.850
and go back and refresh. We have our borders.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.310
Now here's something interesting they can do.

01:35.330 --> 01:42.130
You can do 'col-sm-6' and then 'col-sm-3'.

01:42.210 --> 01:43.650
Don't worry I'll explain what that means.

01:43.650 --> 01:52.610
I'm going to refresh and look at that. The size of this just got smaller and that is because Bootstrap

01:52.820 --> 01:58.390
has the idea of a grid system and this grid system has 12 lines.

01:58.550 --> 02:01.040
So six plus three is nine.

02:01.040 --> 02:07.670
So it's saying that I want this column to have six spaces out of that 12.

02:07.740 --> 02:18.300
And this column to have three spaces out of that 12. So if we add another column 

02:18.300 --> 02:20.450
and six plus three plus three is 12.

02:23.300 --> 02:32.900
I'm going to say 'Extra' here I refresh you'll see that it fills in this gap. What if I put it in four here [col-sm-4].

02:32.920 --> 02:35.210
So that is 13 which is over 12.

02:35.470 --> 02:39.870
Well if I refresh this goes down to the next level.

02:39.900 --> 02:44.010
So you see how easy it is to control things in Bootstrap.

02:44.080 --> 02:54.320
I could also do something like 'column-xs-12' and then 'column-xs-6'

02:54.380 --> 03:00.880
and actually will medium here [col-md-6].

03:03.820 --> 03:06.950
Save let's refresh and see what happens.

03:06.960 --> 03:16.950
Woah. What this is saying that if the size of the window is medium then I want the whole 12 grid system

03:17.130 --> 03:25.070
to the first div and then six of the 12 to the second and then the extra one, six.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.350
So you can see here that that's medium.

03:27.570 --> 03:35.310
But because we have these small properties in here. If I make it smaller you can see that it resorts

03:35.310 --> 03:37.620
down to the six three four grid.

03:37.710 --> 03:45.000
Let's change this back to three [col-sm-3] so it looks better and show you that there's a few other

03:45.000 --> 03:48.410
sizes that we can add.

03:48.450 --> 03:57.600
You can see over here that we have 'Grid options' and we have Small, Medium, Large and Extra large. So let's

03:57.610 --> 04:06.140
do large and see what happens. So for large I want to have everything on their own, so we can do this [col-lg-12]

04:11.060 --> 04:15.220
and save let's refresh and see if you can guess what's about to happen.

04:16.030 --> 04:26.460
I'm going to go from medium to large. Do you see that? 12 12 12 so I want each div to occupy 12 spaces 12 grid sytems.

04:26.460 --> 04:34.450
Which is the full thing. If I go to medium I now occupy with the first one, 12.

04:34.590 --> 04:43.060
The second one, six and six. They should be one after another and if I go down to even smaller 

04:43.060 --> 04:46.830
the small will have six, three and three.

04:46.940 --> 04:54.350
So this is how you can create really responsive websites. And that was the biggest selling feature of

04:54.370 --> 05:00.590
Bootstrap it was solving this really really hard problem of making sure that our website looked good no matter

05:00.590 --> 05:01.770
what the screen size.

05:03.490 --> 05:06.060
So I want you to play around with the grid options here.

05:06.070 --> 05:11.980
This is the hardest concept to grasp in Bootstrap. Once youve learned this.

05:11.980 --> 05:16.660
Its very very easy to create websites extremely fast.

05:16.660 --> 05:18.000
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye.
