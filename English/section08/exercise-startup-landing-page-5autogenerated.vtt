WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:01.450
All right.

00:01.480 --> 00:04.470
It's time to talk about layout now.

00:04.540 --> 00:07.910
We already learned how will layout works and bootstrap.

00:07.910 --> 00:11.640
And we talked about why bootstrap became so popular now.

00:11.770 --> 00:12.450
Don't worry.

00:12.460 --> 00:18.940
Later on in the course I'm going to introduce you to topics like CSX grid and actually talk about really

00:18.970 --> 00:22.750
easy ways to do layout on a page.

00:22.750 --> 00:27.190
But for now we want us to use bootstrap because that's what we learned.

00:27.250 --> 00:31.240
And I'm warning you this is going to seem very overwhelming.

00:31.240 --> 00:37.300
I want to show you how bootstrap does layout because down the road when I introduce you to things like

00:37.390 --> 00:43.780
CSX grid you're going to see how much easier we have it now than we had maybe a few years ago but I

00:43.780 --> 00:49.810
still want you to learn how layout is done in bootstrap because you will encounter it throughout your

00:49.810 --> 00:50.800
career.

00:50.830 --> 00:56.080
Now if you go to the layout section on the bootstrap documentation you see over here that has some pretty

00:56.080 --> 00:57.540
good information.

00:57.610 --> 01:06.110
We can look at the grids and we've already talked about how grid works with bootstrap now.

01:06.120 --> 01:12.060
The first thing we want to do is to have a container and then maybe some rows that we can use columns

01:12.510 --> 01:19.570
on so if we go back to our page and we open up the index got a simple file.

01:19.570 --> 01:22.450
The first thing I want to do around the body.

01:22.450 --> 01:27.220
And one thing I'll do with my sublime text here is actually minimize the head tack here just so we can

01:27.220 --> 01:27.820
see a little bit.

01:27.970 --> 01:30.190
So I'm going to just click on this and look at that.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.940
It's minimized so I can just focus on the body.

01:33.130 --> 01:42.310
The first thing I want to do is say that I want to create a div with a class of container just like

01:42.310 --> 01:47.320
that and then we'll close this right over here.

01:47.650 --> 01:50.460
So let's indent that properly.

01:50.470 --> 01:53.470
Let's save and refresh right.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.490
We have everything in a container.

01:55.490 --> 01:59.630
Next is that we want to ideally all of these things to be in a row.

01:59.660 --> 02:07.100
So we want the H1 the H.R. and the button to just be a row one row that we have that is in the center

02:07.100 --> 02:07.690
of the page.

02:08.390 --> 02:19.280
So I'm just going to wrap this in a div and give it a class of row so once again let's close the div

02:22.820 --> 02:24.710
and indent this again.

02:24.710 --> 02:31.800
If I refresh not much has changed we may have lost the H.R. we'll get back to that in a second but we

02:31.800 --> 02:38.140
have a row now so that if I inspect let's say view developer tools

02:41.370 --> 02:49.380
and I click on this inspect I see well these elements if I go over here and let's open this up.

02:49.380 --> 02:50.790
Make this a little bit smaller.

02:50.880 --> 02:58.900
We see that we have the body we have the div which is the container and then we have the row right here.

02:58.920 --> 03:05.710
All right let me close this let's divide up these items into different sections.

03:05.850 --> 03:10.690
We have the header element that we can use.

03:11.130 --> 03:15.570
And this header element will contain the H one over here.

03:15.570 --> 03:25.890
So we have the header and one thing that we can use with bootstrap is a class called text center and

03:25.890 --> 03:27.670
text center as you might guess.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.880
If I refresh centers the text.

03:31.200 --> 03:31.880
So that's great.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.230
That's our header element.

03:34.230 --> 03:37.610
And we also want to create a another section here.

03:37.650 --> 03:40.430
Let's call it section.

03:40.510 --> 03:52.040
So this is a section element and this section element will also have the class text center.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.230
So if I refresh There you go.

03:55.230 --> 03:58.900
We got our H.R. horizontal line back.

03:59.120 --> 03:59.910
Hmm.

04:00.540 --> 04:05.330
Why isn't this center let's inspect this and find out.

04:06.180 --> 04:12.840
So I can open developer tools by pressing command option i or control option i if you're on a windows

04:12.840 --> 04:13.070
and

04:15.880 --> 04:23.930
let's look at the elements we have the container we have the RO We have the header and then we have

04:24.290 --> 04:25.610
the section.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.250
Mm hmm.

04:26.240 --> 04:33.130
Now we see over here that these ones aren't taking up the full width as we would want of the container.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.320
And we've seen this before with bootstrap.

04:35.390 --> 04:35.660
Right.

04:36.880 --> 04:44.940
We have to use this columns to tell it hey we want to contain or expand along the call

04:47.920 --> 04:54.830
and because bootstrap uses a 12 grid system we can just say in here in the header we want the column

04:55.210 --> 05:02.000
12 grid and then for the section we want the column 12 grid.

05:02.140 --> 05:05.840
So if I refresh There you go look at that.

05:05.840 --> 05:13.040
If I go over here I see that we have the row we have the header and then we have the text which as you

05:13.040 --> 05:21.540
can see contains the full amount of the container in the blue that's looking a lot better.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.250
That's great.

05:23.260 --> 05:29.080
Now if I close this home are taxed and Bunn it's still at the top.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.410
Ideally it's in the middle of the image.

05:31.450 --> 05:34.660
How can we fix this now.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.380
This part is really really tricky.

05:37.510 --> 05:47.530
If I actually search vertical alignment here you'll see that bootstrap has some vertical alignment options

05:48.010 --> 05:56.500
but these ones are using inline inline block inline table which is actually not the recommended way.

05:56.610 --> 06:01.660
Now the way we're going to do this is we're going to use flex.

06:01.830 --> 06:09.570
And this is a new feature with bootstrap because they're using the Flex box utilities that we've learned

06:09.570 --> 06:10.150
about.

06:10.320 --> 06:10.620
Right.

06:11.100 --> 06:21.300
So if I go over here you can see that I can activate the Flex box system by using the D flex class.

06:21.300 --> 06:28.700
So if I copy this and go to container and say deflects if I refresh.

06:28.770 --> 06:29.190
All right.

06:29.190 --> 06:37.750
Nothing happened because we've just enabled flex box but now we want to make sure that we can place

06:37.750 --> 06:49.470
things vertically in the center and this if we scroll down is what we want right here a line items.

06:49.470 --> 06:52.650
If we look over here it's a line items.

06:52.650 --> 07:06.870
Center so if I copy this which is this one over here and we add a line items Center five refresh.

07:07.020 --> 07:10.720
This isn't working and this is a little tricky.

07:11.010 --> 07:14.760
And I'm showing you this just to understand how to debug things.

07:14.790 --> 07:20.640
So let's say you just did this and for some reason you don't understand why this isn't working on the

07:20.640 --> 07:21.800
documentation page.

07:21.810 --> 07:28.120
Clearly it shows us that this should be working well we can inspect.

07:28.130 --> 07:34.310
So let's right click inspect and have a look at our H2 mail page.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.800
We have the container and then the body.

07:37.820 --> 07:41.230
Now you see here how everything is in the container.

07:41.370 --> 07:47.450
And as a matter of fact if we look at the container we're actually aligning items in the center because

07:47.450 --> 07:50.850
the container is actually not the full page.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.490
It's only the top part.

07:52.490 --> 07:53.450
Right.

07:53.450 --> 07:54.970
It's just this part.

07:55.130 --> 08:02.850
So here the container is not fully covering the page.

08:02.870 --> 08:10.370
So what we need to do just like we have in body if we look at style here you see how we have height

08:10.490 --> 08:17.650
of 100 percent all we need to do is tell the container that hey I want you to span the entire height

08:18.130 --> 08:20.400
of the page and then bootstrap.

08:20.410 --> 08:29.460
We can do that by saying height one hundred instead of adding the CSF stuff if I save this and refresh

08:30.520 --> 08:31.310
look at that.

08:31.450 --> 08:32.650
Five hover.

08:32.740 --> 08:40.800
You'll see that my container is now the full length of the page and our writing is right in the middle.

08:40.840 --> 08:45.820
If I scroll up or down look at that it's adjusting properly.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.920
Everything is centered.

08:50.170 --> 08:53.920
Now don't worry if this takes you a long time to figure out.

08:53.920 --> 09:01.270
Sometimes it involves googling around figure things out like it said later on in the CSX layout section

09:01.270 --> 09:05.060
of the course I'll actually show you how to make this so much simpler.

09:05.110 --> 09:11.770
Now the last thing I want to do is well right here I want to have a bit of space between the writing

09:12.070 --> 09:13.380
and the button.

09:13.540 --> 09:15.090
So what can we do here.

09:15.920 --> 09:23.450
I want to another section in between these two to hopefully buffer them away from each other so we can

09:23.450 --> 09:32.120
create that fairly easily we can just add a new div and we'll give it a class here of buffer that we'll

09:32.120 --> 09:41.210
have to write ourselves in this buffer class will be in between the header and then the horizontal line

09:41.210 --> 09:42.190
and the button.

09:42.230 --> 09:49.790
So let's also give this a column of 12 because we want to make sure that it covers the entire area.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.130
But right now there's nothing.

09:52.130 --> 09:55.040
If I right click here and inspect

09:59.320 --> 10:03.220
you'll see here that I have the buffer but the buffer doesn't have anything.

10:03.220 --> 10:10.390
It's completely empty because while there's nothing inside here but we can add a style let's say dot

10:10.690 --> 10:17.900
buffer in this buffer will have a height of what should we say.

10:17.950 --> 10:25.220
Well if I do let's say 50 pixels and I refresh look at that I get a nice little buffer.

10:25.230 --> 10:33.690
So now if I scroll over to buffer you see that I have a 50 pixel height buffer but I always like using

10:33.780 --> 10:36.900
our yen instead of pixels so let's do our.

10:37.020 --> 10:39.930
Let's see what five RTM means.

10:39.930 --> 10:40.160
All right.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.080
That's good.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.840
Maybe a little bit more.

10:43.840 --> 10:44.790
Let's do 10.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.730
Ah yeah let's save and refresh.

10:48.730 --> 10:49.120
All right.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.900
That looks actually quite nice.

10:50.950 --> 10:54.310
Fly close this down open it up.

10:54.750 --> 10:55.070
Yeah.

10:55.080 --> 10:55.680
Look at that.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.880
Now looks really really nice.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.040
And there we go.

10:59.070 --> 11:02.010
We have our startup landing page right here.

11:02.070 --> 11:04.170
Everything looks pretty nice right.

11:04.260 --> 11:08.000
And the way we've organized things seems pretty clean.

11:08.040 --> 11:18.280
Our button is well when we hover available but whenever I click on this button nothing's happening.

11:18.280 --> 11:27.060
Ideally we have a new page that opens up so that we can enter or our customers can enter their e-mails.

11:27.160 --> 11:32.560
And this is the exciting part that we're going to get to in the next video I'll see in that one by.
