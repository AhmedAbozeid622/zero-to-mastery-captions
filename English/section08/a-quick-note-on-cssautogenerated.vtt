Hey there I want to take a quick video to explain something.

00:07.050 --> 00:13.350
And this is something that I made the mistake of when I first started off when I first started teaching

00:13.350 --> 00:15.320
myself programming.

00:15.460 --> 00:20.500
You see you start off with HTML and things are fairly simple.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.800
You learn some tags.

00:21.820 --> 00:26.880
You learn some attributes and you starting to get it... how websites are built.

00:27.430 --> 00:32.890
And then you learn about CSS and all the things that you can do to websites to make them pretty

00:32.980 --> 00:33.790
and beautiful.

00:35.010 --> 00:40.030
But then you start encountering all these CSS properties.

00:40.020 --> 00:45.960
There's so many of them there's no way for you to remember all of them and they each act differently

00:46.080 --> 00:54.150
on the element so that things like positioning a navigation bar becomes really difficult because you

00:54.150 --> 00:59.870
have one button that for some reason is styled differently and you can't figure out why.

01:00.160 --> 01:07.680
And that is a problem that everybody has CSS is notoriously difficult and frustrating to learn.

01:07.930 --> 01:14.020
But this is the mistake that I made when I first started off. I thought I had to know everything in

01:14.030 --> 01:14.640
HTML.

01:14.940 --> 01:19.480
Everything in CSS before I even touched Javascript.

01:19.480 --> 01:26.800
So I spent way too much time learning everything about HTML. Everything about CSS... getting frustrated

01:26.800 --> 01:36.550
and frustrated because I couldn't get my websites to look like somebody that has been doing it for years.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.840
And here's the thing.

01:38.050 --> 01:43.360
If this was that easy then every single person would be doing it but it's not.

01:43.690 --> 01:50.800
It's tough to master these skills but each day you make small little progress step by step.

01:50.950 --> 01:53.180
So you become better.

01:53.190 --> 02:00.140
However, I don't want you to fall into the trap that I did... that is to not start off learning javascript

02:00.290 --> 02:07.730
right away, because you see these circles over here these circle the size of them represent how important

02:07.730 --> 02:09.250
they are to your career.

02:10.420 --> 02:18.180
Now if you want to be a web designer. Designing websites and making things look pretty then CSS is

02:18.180 --> 02:20.060
quite important to you.

02:20.100 --> 02:27.330
However, if you want to be a developer: somebody that works on logic on javascript and builds applications

02:27.960 --> 02:36.660
Well you need to focus on Javascript, because although you need to know CSS those things that you're

02:36.660 --> 02:39.700
going to work on while working on Javascript.

02:39.900 --> 02:47.010
So each time you're learning javascript and working with websites you're also as an effect working

02:47.010 --> 02:49.630
with CSS.

02:49.670 --> 02:56.540
So although your knowledge might not feel complete right now with CSS, by using javascript and starting

02:56.540 --> 03:01.630
with javascript as soon as possible we focus on the most important topic at hand.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.910
And little by little as you're learning javascript you're also going to learn more and more about CSS

03:07.910 --> 03:10.870
So I encourage you.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.440
Trust me on this, because I've been through it as well.

03:14.470 --> 03:20.260
Don't start learning every single CSS property trying to memorize everything because that's not how

03:20.260 --> 03:21.190
you work.

03:21.250 --> 03:30.010
A web developer is somebody that uses javascript. Javascript to make smart applications, and that is what

03:30.010 --> 03:39.100
your focus should be on, and along the way you will also build your HTML and CSS knowledge... and that is

03:39.100 --> 03:41.340
the path that we're taking with this course.

03:41.500 --> 03:45.460
Not the longest slowest path but the most efficient path.

03:47.710 --> 03:48.640
I'll see in the next video.
