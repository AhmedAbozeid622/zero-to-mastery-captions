WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.490
All right.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.510
Let's get going here now the first thing
we want to do is change this hello to.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.920
Well the biggest startup event of the year.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.790
Very dramatic.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.140
I know.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.260
So let's do that.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:21.280
I'm just going to say the biggest
startup event of the year.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.770
That's right.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.410
OK.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.169
Let's save.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.152
So I'm doing "Command+S"
or if you're on Windows, "Ctrl+S"

00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:30.439
and then refresh
"Command+R" or if you're on

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.040
windows "Ctrl+R".

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.080
All right.
There we go.

00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:36.259
That's great.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.640
We also seem to have a button
that says find out more.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.310
So let's do that as well.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.890
We'll say "button".

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.599
Find out more.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600
There we go.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.570
If I refresh here.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.390
There you go.

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:56.610
Our startup landing page is well
frankly still looking fairly ugly.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.789
Now the next thing we want to do is
we want to have this background image.

00:01:03.413 --> 00:01:04.889
But before we get to that

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.920
I want to talk a little bit about
how we can set up our HTML page

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:12.649
so that we have good responsive design.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.539
So right now nothing much is going on.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.389
You can see here that I
can adjust the screen size.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.089
But we don't have much
happening on our page.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.930
So if we go back to the
Bootstrap documentation

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:30.739
in the quick start guide if I
scroll all the way to the bottom

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.509
you see that I get a starter template here

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.430
and you might notice here something
that we haven't seen before

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.180
which is this part over here
called a "required meta tag"

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.589
and you can see here that this is actually

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.870
something that we can copy and paste
and place right below our title here.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.110
Just like that.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.829
Now let's make this a little
bit bigger so we can see

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.629
and I'll make the writing
smaller just so you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.539
can see over here exactly what's happening.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.030
So this meta tag allows us to

00:02:05.554 --> 00:02:10.849
add new information to our HTML page
and there's different things that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.300
we can provide.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.370
Now in most websites you'll actually see these two
lines very often as a matter of fact it's recommended

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.550
that you always add.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.260
Now what exactly do they do?

00:02:24.324 --> 00:02:31.044
Well if we scroll down here you'll see
that we have the "responsive meta tag".

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.948
Essentially

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.720
this line here which says viewport
allows us to create web pages

00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:41.279
that are developed mobile first.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.189
That is we let the page
know or the browser know

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.589
that this page should work
on mobile devices and things

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.230
like scrolling or touching or zooming

00:02:53.254 --> 00:02:58.699
on a mobile device is going
to work with this tag.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.029
Now this is something I'm going to
leave for you to learn more about

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.230
and it's something we'll talk
about later in the course

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.662
but these meta tags are
just useful things to add

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:13.930
to our projects anytime
we create a new page.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.949
And then finally this top meta tag

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.070
uses UTF-8 encoding essentially
it's saying hey we're going to use

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.090
this form of encoding to
write text on our pages.

00:03:26.114 --> 00:03:29.979
Again something that if you're
curious you can read up on your own.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.020
But now that we've set this up so
that it's good for mobile as well.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.339
Let's try to include this
background image into our page.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.039
Now when it comes to
background images on a website

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.070
that's a very common thing.

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:50.649
You'll see a lot of people adding
background images to a website

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.980
or maybe patterns or some sort of colors

00:03:54.504 --> 00:03:59.219
and when a common problem
happens I always like well, Google

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.230
and one of the first things
that you'll encounter

00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.139
is this perfect full page
background image by "CSS-TRICKS"

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.640
which we've seen before.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.019
Now if you scroll all the way down

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.019
it tells us a way for us to make
sure that we use the image in a

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.909
full page background so that it stretches
it flexes as the view port changes.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.030
Now over here it actually
gives us a copy and paste

00:04:28.054 --> 00:04:29.569
way that we can use it ourselves.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.039
So I'm going to just copy this

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.699
go to my style page and
just add this to our CSS.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.269
Now you'll see over here that we're using
"background" over here with the "url".

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.049
So we want to adjust it to "header.jpg"

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.849
Because that's the url of the header.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.669
And the key here is these lines.

00:04:57.293 --> 00:05:00.693
It saying hey we don't
want to repeat the image

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.560
we want you to keep it centered
and we want you to keep it fixed.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.239
And by using this line it stretches
or at least it fills the entire page

00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:17.850
with our image and as long as we
have "background-size" as "cover".

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.190
Well let's see what happens.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.220
I'm going to refresh.

00:05:21.244 --> 00:05:23.199
Hey and look at that!

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.390
Now I have this image

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:30.065
that adapts to our page.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.050
But the cool part is if I
open the developer tools here.

00:05:34.074 --> 00:05:41.974
Let's say view developer tools you'll
notice that the image actually bumps up

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.780
so that the center of the
image well is always centered.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.539
How cool is that!

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.630
So this is a very useful trick to
have your background very flexible.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.960
All right.

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:00.469
So we have our background, hmmm!

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.130
Unfortunately our writing right now is
hard to see the button still kind of ugly.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.260
So let's fix a few things in our HTML page.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.239
Now remember we have Bootstrap so we
can start using some Bootstrap classes now.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.930
One thing that I want to do is

00:06:15.954 --> 00:06:26.439
with this "h1" tag I want to maybe use a
"strong" element to emphasize the header.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.370
So make sure we close this and I'm gonna
make this bigger just so you can see.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.089
And if I refresh.

00:06:34.213 --> 00:06:36.113
All right that's emphasized
a little bit more.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.029
We also want to make sure that
this "h1" tag we can actually see

00:06:40.053 --> 00:06:42.053
So we can go into our style

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:50.860
and just create a new "h1" style that
will have a let's say a "font-size"

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.700
of let's say "3rem".

00:06:57.788 --> 00:07:03.817
And then we'll give it a "color"
of, what should we do here?

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.079
Well one thing that I always like to do when
I'm trying to figure out what color I want

00:07:08.103 --> 00:07:10.103
is to

00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:15.124
go to a page let's say
like the startup over here

00:07:15.148 --> 00:07:17.148
open up the developer tools

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.309
make sure this is a little
bit bigger so we can see

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:27.033
and then find somewhere on the page
where you have this color palette.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.029
If I actually click on
this and I'm on Chrome

00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:34.153
Look at that! It opens up a
little color palette for us

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.269
so I can actually move around things

00:07:37.193 --> 00:07:41.693
and grab the hacks of
the color that I want.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.170
In our case I want the color
to be well let's find out.

00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:47.894
How can I copy the color of this page?

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.260
I can just click on select an element.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.240
This little icon here.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.390
And then if I hover over this look at that.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.330
It shows me exactly what
color this element has.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.810
You can see over here that
this is the hex color.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.730
So I'm just going to copy that
come back and paste it in.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:13.530
Now if I save both of these files
and refresh that's much better.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.570
I like that a lot.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.479
All right.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.060
We're making progress with our page.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.709
It's getting closer but
we still have a lot to do.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.991
So let's take a break and I'll
see you in the next video.
