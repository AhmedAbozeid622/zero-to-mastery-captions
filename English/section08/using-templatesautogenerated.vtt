00:00.840 --> 00:02.170
Congratulations.

00:02.340 --> 00:08.580
You're actually learning quite a lot although things might still seem a little intimidating.

00:08.760 --> 00:14.690
You now have a new found power where you can create Web sites you can put them online.

00:15.680 --> 00:22.670
Now there's still lots to learn but one of the neat things about knowing how much we know now is that

00:22.700 --> 00:27.490
you can leverage other people's templates.

00:27.510 --> 00:29.000
Now what does that mean.

00:29.010 --> 00:34.230
It means that unlike the startup landing page that we just created you don't have to create everything

00:34.260 --> 00:35.610
from scratch.

00:35.610 --> 00:43.400
As a matter of fact if you Google free Asia all five templates or free a small CSF templates there's

00:43.410 --> 00:47.850
a ton of free resources online that you can use.

00:47.850 --> 00:52.440
Now after this lesson I'm going to link to some of my favorite free resources.

00:52.440 --> 00:56.410
But one of them is mash up template here.

00:56.420 --> 00:59.830
You can actually use a bunch of free templates for yourself.

01:01.090 --> 01:09.070
And if I let's say go to complex here or no let's to factory I can actually download the files here

01:09.430 --> 01:14.260
as HMO and check this out find out.

01:14.480 --> 01:20.450
Openness I now have these files and there's a lot of files that we still don't know.

01:20.510 --> 01:25.770
There's some javascript here that we haven't talked about yet and we'll cover these in later lessons.

01:25.850 --> 01:30.860
But the thing here is that you know about HMO and CSX.

01:30.890 --> 01:39.140
So now if you actually double click on this HMO you have a Web site that you can use and customize to

01:39.140 --> 01:43.630
your liking and this Web site is free for you to use.

01:43.660 --> 01:45.700
You can now change the background image.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.730
You can change what the button does.

01:47.740 --> 01:53.370
You can do different things and you can customize it just like we have with a startup landing page.

01:53.710 --> 02:03.280
But to your own liking by just changing the AML and CSX files which we have right here this is the power

02:03.280 --> 02:04.550
of the web.

02:04.600 --> 02:12.730
The Web allows programmers to share pieces of code so that we don't have to constantly reinvent things

02:12.730 --> 02:17.500
from scratch just like bootstrap allowed us to do things easily.

02:17.590 --> 02:24.890
In terms of layout templates allow us to create Web sites instead of from scratch.

02:24.890 --> 02:28.260
We get to start with a basic template.

02:28.280 --> 02:32.390
Now I want to try building your own startup landing page.

02:32.390 --> 02:38.580
Up until now I've shown you step by step but you have the power to create something custom to your liking.

02:38.750 --> 02:45.930
You can use something like mashup templates or you can elaborate on the current startup page.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.520
You have the power to do it.

02:47.660 --> 02:52.240
And although it may seem a little bit hard right now we're still starting off.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.380
It's good for you to get that practice of doing things on your own.

02:56.450 --> 02:58.170
Experimenting on your own.

02:58.220 --> 03:04.970
And even if you fail even if it takes you hours to just center a text or a button it's going to be good

03:04.970 --> 03:06.230
practice in the long run.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.950
So give it a go.

03:08.060 --> 03:11.240
Create your own custom startup landing page.

03:11.630 --> 03:15.800
And if you're done go share it in our Dischord server.

03:15.980 --> 03:16.920
I'll see you in the next one.

03:17.560 --> 03:17.740
Bob.
