00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.730
Welcome back.

00:00:01.731 --> 00:00:04.119
So how are we going to
build this from scratch

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.919
based on what we've learned so far.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.079
Well we're going to use Bootstrap
for this because we just learned it

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.379
and I actually gave you some starter files
attached to the last lesson.

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:17.519
If we take a look.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.660
That's right.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.140
We had a header image.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.059
We had an "index.html" file
and then a "style.css" file.

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:31.410
So you can open these make sure
they're all in the same folder.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.579
I called mine "startup" with an exclamation
mark because this is an exciting project

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.170
and in our case
we'll use Sublime Text.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.160
We should have something like this.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.325
So we have our "index.html" file
our "style.css" and then

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.290
our header image.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.139
Now I filled in a few things
for you just to get us started.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.920
Nothing too crazy though.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.180
Don't worry.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.676
One is we've used some
Google fonts so that we can

00:01:01.677 --> 00:01:05.159
use this "Montserrat" font
which I think is kind of

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.420
nice from the Google fonts

00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:11.144
and we enable that
in our style sheet by saying body and HTML.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.630
I want to make sure that
the font family has this setting.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.060
If not we'll use "sans-serif".

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.419
I've also set width and height for "100%".

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.478
That's always something
good to have to make sure

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.719
that the body and HTML cover
100 percent of whatever

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.700
we see on the screen.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.880
Next we have our "Bootstrap CSS" from a
"CDN" or a "Content Delivery Network".

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.787
And the reason I've added this
here, is that so you don't have to

00:01:41.788 --> 00:01:44.690
actually include a Bootstrap file yourself.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.269
If I actually go to the Bootstrap page
and I go to "Quick Start"

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.769
you'll see that right here we can just copy

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.760
and paste this, just like here
with the Bootstrap CSS file.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.410
So that way right away as soon
as we copy and paste this line

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:05.389
we have Bootstrap available to us.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.790
Now notice here how we have
versions of Bootstrap.

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.017
In this case it's "4.3.1".

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.141
Now this number as the
time passes is going to get

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:19.365
bigger and bigger.
Because Bootstrap is a constantly

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.860
evolving library
as developers make updates.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.025
But as long as you use
a number higher than this

00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:28.527
everything in this
project should work.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.129
Like I said most of the time no matter

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.029
when you're watching this video
as long as you copy this

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.420
or you use my starter files
everything should work.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.050
And then finally we have our style sheet.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.170
Nothing new here right.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.050
Because we've already seen this before
we have our "style.css" file

00:02:46.174 --> 00:02:49.459
and our style file just has
this for now.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.160
We also have our header image which
again is a nice little laptop image

00:02:55.184 --> 00:02:57.184
for our startup landing page.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.109
Now this is the website over here that is
completely blank because we have nothing in the body.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.770
So let's just have a "h1" that says
"Helllloooooo" right here.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.920
Save it and refresh.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.670
Look at that! We have

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.270
"Helllloooooo"

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.749
Now notice here how
fast I did that I just

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.680
pressed "Command+R" on
my laptop which is a Mac.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.373
If you have Windows it's
"Ctrl+R" to refresh the web

00:03:25.374 --> 00:03:28.699
page and you notice here
that the font is being

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.540
applied once again because
we have our font-family CSS set.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.728
So there's our page,
our setup and there is what we

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.919
want to get to now if you
want you can go off on

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.569
your own and try to attempt to
built this from scratch yourself.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.070
Otherwise I'll see you in the next video

00:03:50.094 --> 00:03:53.994
to actually get our page to
look a little bit more like this

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.410
and less like this.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.110
I'll see in the next one.
Bye bye.
