00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.190
Welcome back.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.969
I want to show you another easier way
to put your page online on GitHub.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.570
That is fairly new.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.399
All we need to do is
click on a new repository.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.439
We can create whatever we want.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.350
"startup-of-the-year"
we'll call it that for now.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.179
We'll make sure it's public.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.360
We can add a description if we want.

00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:29.144
And we can initialize this
repository with a "README".

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.640
Now if I click Create repository

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.340
I now have an empty project

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:43.364
and all we need to do here
is click on upload files

00:00:43.888 --> 00:00:47.929
and we can just drag and drop our files.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.590
In my case I can just grab these
three files we've been working on.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.719
Drag them over here.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.120
It's going to upload them and
we'll just hit commit changes

00:00:59.044 --> 00:01:02.044
and check it out once that's done

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.770
we have our page.
Now in order for this to work

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.380
we have to make sure that
there's an index.html file

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.804
and all we need to do is now go to Settings

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.999
scroll all the way down
to GitHub Pages right here

00:01:22.423 --> 00:01:25.923
select the source as the master branch

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.049
and don't worry we're gonna go
over GitHub and how it works.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.309
Later on the course we have
a dedicated section for it.

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.653
but I just want to make sure
that we can put things online

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.459
so you can show off to your friends.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.089
If I scroll back to GitHub Pages now

00:01:40.113 --> 00:01:45.020
you'll see that I have your site is
ready to be published right here.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:50.800
So I can actually copy this link
or click on it and look at that.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.130
At this URL my website is now online.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.420
And as you can see it
works just like we had.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.470
But this time it's an
actual website online.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.980
So this link I can send to
my friends and show off.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.110
Now one thing I like to do here when I
create a page on GitHub is to copy this link

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:18.934
go back to the project

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.310
and add it to the description
here as the website.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.850
So that in the future

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.760
I can just click on here and
I'm directed to my website.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.370
All right.

00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:42.150
That was a lot of work but congratulations
you have your website online.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.119
Go share with your friends with your
family with your dog with your enemies

00:02:47.143 --> 00:02:49.870
and I'll see you in the
next video. Bye bye.
