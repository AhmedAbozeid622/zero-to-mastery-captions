WEBVTT

00:01.190 --> 00:01.640
Welcome back.

00:02.300 --> 00:07.970
I want to show you a nother easier way to put your page online on github.

00:07.970 --> 00:09.570
That is fairly new.

00:09.770 --> 00:13.400
All we need to do is click on a new repository.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.440
We can create whatever we want.

00:15.440 --> 00:21.350
Startup of the year we'll call it that for now.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.180
We'll make sure it's public.

00:23.180 --> 00:28.960
We can add a description if we want and we can initialize this repository with a me.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.640
Now if I click Create repository

00:34.520 --> 00:46.340
I now have an empty project and all we need to do here is click on upload files and we can just drag

00:46.370 --> 00:47.930
and drop our files.

00:47.930 --> 00:51.590
In my case I can just grab these three files we've been working on.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.720
Drag them over here.

00:53.720 --> 01:03.020
It's going to upload them and we'll just hit commit changes and check it out once that's done.

01:03.060 --> 01:06.770
We have our page now in order for this to work.

01:06.780 --> 01:14.980
We have to make sure that there's an index dot H2 Alpha and all we need to do is now go to Settings

01:16.750 --> 01:27.500
scroll all the way down to get hub pages right here select the source as the master branch and don't

01:27.500 --> 01:30.050
worry we're gonna go over GitHub and how it works.

01:30.050 --> 01:34.610
Later on the course we have a dedicated section for it but I just want to make sure that we can put

01:34.610 --> 01:37.260
things online so we can show off to your friends.

01:37.460 --> 01:44.090
If I scroll back to get hub pages now you'll see that I have your site is ready to be published right

01:44.090 --> 01:45.020
here.

01:45.020 --> 01:50.800
So I can actually copy this link or click on it and look at that.

01:50.970 --> 01:55.130
At this you are real my Web site is now online.

01:55.830 --> 02:00.420
And as you can see it works just like we had.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.470
But this time it's an actual Web site online.

02:03.530 --> 02:08.980
So this link I can send to my friends and show off.

02:09.050 --> 02:18.710
Now one thing I like to do here when I create a page on github is to copy this link go back to the project

02:20.220 --> 02:25.310
and added to the description here as the Web site.

02:25.590 --> 02:26.850
So that in the future

02:30.460 --> 02:35.760
I can just click on here and I'm directed to my Web site.

02:35.770 --> 02:36.370
All right.

02:36.370 --> 02:42.150
That was a lot of work but congratulations you have your Web site online.

02:42.220 --> 02:48.520
Go share with your friends with your family with your dog with your enemies and I'll see you in the

02:48.520 --> 02:49.870
next video by.
