Great job getting this far in the course. You should be proud of yourself. Now using everything that we've

00:07.780 --> 00:14.170
learned so far, which is a lot, we're going to build our first start up landing page.

00:14.200 --> 00:25.590
I want you to build something like this. Something responsive with a background image, some text 

00:25.590 --> 00:26.860
and a nice little button.

00:27.140 --> 00:33.800
And the next lesson you can either grab these files off this website and just use this as a demo or

00:33.800 --> 00:37.460
your own and I'll show you how to do, this.

00:38.390 --> 00:39.250
That's right.

00:39.320 --> 00:44.720
We're going to create a sign up form. So that next time you have your big startup idea you can whip

00:44.720 --> 00:48.570
out a website really really quick and start gathering some e-mails.

00:49.530 --> 00:51.480
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
