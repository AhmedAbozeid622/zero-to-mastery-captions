00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.190
Holy moly!

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.230
Good job getting this far in the course.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.660
You should really really
be proud of yourself

00:00:06.684 --> 00:00:08.570
because we've learned a lot.

00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:11.574
And now we're gonna build
something really exciting.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.240
We're gonna build a startup landing page.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.170
A landing page like this.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.120
That well is responsive

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:24.044
but most importantly it has some text.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.100
It has a button.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.500
But check this out.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.270
When you click on the button it takes you to a
form to sign up and collect email addresses.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.920
That's right.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.790
We're building a startup landing page.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.220
I'm going to show you
how to do it step by step

00:00:38.244 --> 00:00:41.244
and you can grab the starter
files attached to this lesson

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.070
because we're gonna build this from scratch

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:49.590
and see how we can put something online
that you can now share with your friends.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.540
Next time you have a big
startup idea. Let's get started.
