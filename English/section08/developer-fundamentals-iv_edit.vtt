Welcome back to another developer fundamentals video. You know who we haven't seen in a while.

00:06.950 --> 00:09.890
My friend Jean-Claude Van Damme. How are you doing these days Jean?

00:12.790 --> 00:13.530
All right.

00:13.780 --> 00:19.620
So what is this developer fundamental there we're going to teach? Well I have over here.

00:19.640 --> 00:27.590
Animate.CSS and this is another CSS file that we can download to animate things.

00:27.590 --> 00:33.780
So all I need to do is click 'Download Animate.css' and I have the CSS file

00:33.870 --> 00:35.420
downloaded for me.

00:35.450 --> 00:36.670
So let's open that up.

00:37.760 --> 00:46.610
You'll see over here that yep this is a massive CSS file that I just downloaded. And this is how Bootstrap

00:46.760 --> 00:49.690
that we've seen in previous videos, works.

00:49.740 --> 00:56.690
They're essentially providing a CSS file for us with all these properties already preset.

00:56.690 --> 01:02.610
And we also have all the classes that we need to use them.

01:02.680 --> 01:07.650
So let's say I wanted to use this and I'm just going to copy this for now.

01:07.900 --> 01:14.100
And I have an empty website and I'm going to copy and paste the CSS for us.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.070
Just think about how powerful that is.

01:16.070 --> 01:23.750
We're able to not start from scratch but use what other people have created to make our websites faster.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.530
To show you this

01:25.660 --> 01:33.010
let's open up this file (index.html) into our browser. OK it's completely empty.

01:33.470 --> 01:43.530
And let's just have a 'h1' Animate Me '/h1'. I'm going to save and refresh and looking at

01:43.530 --> 01:49.900
Animate.css I can add the. Let's add bounce to our header.

01:50.780 --> 01:56.450
All we need to do is click on something like 'View on GitHub' and it will explain for us what we can

01:56.450 --> 02:00.880
add and I'll just save you the trouble of reading.

02:00.890 --> 02:10.720
But all we need to do is this. Copy and add the class animated and then whatever animation we want.

02:10.730 --> 02:11.420
In this library

02:11.420 --> 02:12.440
that's how it works.

02:12.470 --> 02:22.060
You just need to say a class and type animated first and then any of the actions that were provided

02:22.210 --> 02:23.020
on the website.

02:23.170 --> 02:29.810
So in our case it was 'h1 class="animated infinite bounce" '. Save and refresh and..

02:29.830 --> 02:33.030
Well we haven't linked our style sheet here so let's do that.

02:34.600 --> 02:41.390
And we should be really good at this by now because we've done it plenty of times. Save and refresh.

02:41.410 --> 02:44.480
Look at that. our header is now animated.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.140
Let's see what else we can do with this.

02:47.140 --> 02:51.480
We can do jello.

02:51.490 --> 02:56.170
Actually let's do something more exciting maybe flip, wow I like that one.

02:56.170 --> 02:58.750
OK. So we want to do flip.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.120
We can type in 'flip' and refresh here.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.060
You see that? Let's do that infinite, so we can see it.

03:11.690 --> 03:13.310
Wooo there you go.

03:13.910 --> 03:17.730
I'm going to stop that because that's going to get us dizzy. Refresh.

03:17.730 --> 03:18.920
There you go.

03:19.040 --> 03:26.900
Now the fundamental here that I want to show you is that when we're building websites it is very rare

03:26.900 --> 03:29.660
that we build something from scratch.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.590
Most of the time you want to build on top of something that has already been created.

03:33.590 --> 03:39.280
Otherwise the whole environment of being a developer would be very very tedious.

03:39.350 --> 03:44.500
How much of a waste is it if somebody has already created a solution that you need.

03:44.640 --> 03:50.710
So as a developer you want to be efficient with your time and your limited resources.

03:50.850 --> 03:58.960
So you want to find things like Bootstrap or even Animate.CSS if they solve your certain problems.

03:59.160 --> 04:03.500
And that is true for CSS as well as JavaScript when we get into it.

04:03.500 --> 04:11.130
You want to find solutions that already exist and only if they don't exist already

04:12.120 --> 04:14.190
then you can implement your own.

04:14.190 --> 04:20.020
Finally I want to show you one other tool and that is creative tim.

04:20.220 --> 04:29.440
So if you click on 'Creative Tim'. They create Bootstrap themes.

04:29.600 --> 04:38.480
They're using the Bootstrap toolkit to build their own styles and their own little customized actions

04:38.690 --> 04:40.020
to make it even better.

04:40.370 --> 04:47.360
So if I go to 'Categories' over here and we'll do 'UI kits' you'll see over here that they have all these

04:47.360 --> 04:49.160
things that we can use.

04:49.220 --> 05:01.300
So if we click on 'Paper Kit 2 PRO'. Let's find a free one actually if I click on 'price low to high'.

05:01.300 --> 05:07.410
There you go we have our 'Get Shit Done' and we also have 'Paper Kit 2'.

05:07.520 --> 05:14.960
So if I click on this and I'm going to make this full screen. This allows us to build something like

05:14.960 --> 05:25.500
this very very easily with their own custom design and all we need to do is do a free download. And you'll

05:25.500 --> 05:27.060
see that when we download this

05:30.510 --> 05:32.700
we have all the files that we need.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.700
And let's open it up.

05:34.930 --> 05:35.570
Look at that.

05:35.750 --> 05:46.350
We have this website that just like Bootstrap we can use these buttons and these different styles and

05:46.350 --> 05:50.990
navigation, progress bars and forms and everything that you need.

05:51.060 --> 05:59.220
And because we know now, how html files and CSS files work we can actually start customizing this

05:59.370 --> 06:04.120
and we can open up an index.html file and start editing.

06:04.380 --> 06:12.560
Or if we go into assets and CSS. We can start adding our own CSS values to it.

06:13.750 --> 06:21.900
And you'll see a lot of developers that do this exactly they're freelancers and people need just

06:21.900 --> 06:27.580
websites built and they're able to build websites really really fast by using something like

06:27.580 --> 06:32.960
Creative Tim. Because as you can see they've already built really nice looking components for you.

06:32.960 --> 06:38.670
There's paid ones that you can get and that is one avenue that you can go.

06:38.780 --> 06:46.070
But I do argue that these type of websites can only take you so far.

06:46.430 --> 06:54.320
And in order to build real applications, real complex applications and even garner higher salaries and

06:54.320 --> 07:01.520
make your skills really valuable. We need to learn JavaScript and we need to become better than just

07:01.970 --> 07:05.050
using templates and CSS.

07:05.630 --> 07:11.360
And that's what we're going to get into the next section that is JavaScript that is when the real power

07:12.170 --> 07:15.340
comes. See you in that one, bye bye.
