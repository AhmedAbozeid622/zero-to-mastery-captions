Hello, in this video I'm going to introduce you to something called Bootstrap.

00:05.830 --> 00:12.910
If you haven't heard before Bootstrap is one of the most popular projects ever for developers.

00:12.910 --> 00:19.060
And what it is is just a CSS file and JavaScript file.

00:19.420 --> 00:23.380
But why would that be one of the most popular projects.

00:23.380 --> 00:30.600
Well one thing you might have noticed is that writing CSS from scratch is a bit of a pain.

00:30.610 --> 00:36.190
Would it be nice if you can use something that has already been created by somebody so that not every

00:36.190 --> 00:41.400
single developer has to keep reinventing the wheel and keep writing everything from scratch.

00:41.530 --> 00:48.250
And that is the idea behind Bootstrap. Bootstrap was created to solve this problem so that we can create

00:48.250 --> 00:54.220
websites really really fast by using somebody elses CSS and building on top of it.

00:55.060 --> 01:00.590
There's also another project called Foundation that does the same thing and they have their own styles.

01:00.610 --> 01:05.570
But again Bootstrap is the more popular of the two so we'll focus on that.

01:05.650 --> 01:12.770
If we click on 'Get started' here go have a quick set up instruction and in the next video we'll actually

01:12.860 --> 01:14.370
build something with Bootstrap.

01:14.420 --> 01:22.520
But I want to show you if you go down to 'Components' what the big sell of Bootstrap is and that is it

01:22.520 --> 01:25.490
has all of these things pre-built for you.

01:25.490 --> 01:30.280
So if I wanted to let's say have a 'navigation bar'.

01:30.890 --> 01:39.470
Well that's already built for me with dropdowns and links and all I have to do is copy and paste this

01:39.470 --> 01:45.530
code and you'll see over here that they already have classes attached to them. And these classes will

01:45.530 --> 01:50.120
be associated with the CSS file that I will download from Bootstrap.

01:50.120 --> 01:55.470
So anytime I use something like 'navbar' it will use the default Bootstrap stuff.

01:55.910 --> 02:00.740
And there's many things that you can do. As you can see all I need to do is copy and paste this code

02:00.770 --> 02:02.710
and I have myself a 'card'.

02:02.750 --> 02:06.840
You can imagine how fast making websites is with this.

02:06.860 --> 02:13.280
Now the one thing I do want to point out is you might be asking why do I need to also download JavaScript.

02:13.280 --> 02:19.040
We haven't really learned that topic yet in this course and there are some things in Bootstrap such

02:19.220 --> 02:21.120
as 'dropdown' menus.

02:21.140 --> 02:25.690
You can see how they're adding behavior, some actions to our website.

02:25.730 --> 02:32.830
If I go to let's say 'modals' for example and I click on 'Launch demo modal'.

02:33.170 --> 02:38.050
Well this uses JavaScript because there's some action within our website.

02:38.180 --> 02:42.170
We won't worry too much about that and that's something we'll get into when we get to the 

02:42.170 --> 02:43.120
javascript section.

02:43.400 --> 02:50.840
But you can see here that with Bootstrap by just downloading a CSS file and a JavaScript file we have

02:50.900 --> 02:53.020
all these tools at our disposal.

02:53.030 --> 03:00.110
Now you might be asking yourself one other thing and that is, well if everybody uses these won't we all

03:00.110 --> 03:08.130
have the same looking websites? And no, the beauty of Bootstrap is that these are just building blocks.

03:08.940 --> 03:15.180
You have all these classes that you can use but then you can add your own custom CSS styles on top of

03:15.180 --> 03:17.950
these to make it different.

03:17.970 --> 03:24.810
So if I go to 'Buttons' for example, well by using these classes I have all these beautiful buttons but if I

03:24.810 --> 03:31.230
wanted to change the behavior of button 'Primary' which is this one. I could create my own CSS file and

03:31.230 --> 03:37.410
just put it right after the Bootstrap file and change the primary color to let's say orange.

03:37.410 --> 03:45.450
And just to show you if you go to the 'Expo' tab here,Bootstrap actually has a whole bunch of websites

03:45.690 --> 03:52.550
that are have been built with Bootstrap and you can see that they all look very very different.

03:52.550 --> 03:57.170
So in the next video we're going to build ourself a Bootstrap website.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.070
I'll see you in that one. Bye-bye
