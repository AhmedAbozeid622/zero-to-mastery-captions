WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:02.620
All right everybody.

00:02.630 --> 00:10.040
This is the exciting part because up until now well we've created our startup planning page.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.030
It looks great but it's only on our laptops.

00:13.070 --> 00:13.690
Right.

00:13.700 --> 00:18.810
If you're starting a business you're not going to go to every customer.

00:18.810 --> 00:22.160
Give them your laptop and say hey check out my startup landing page.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.690
No we want to use the Internet right.

00:24.690 --> 00:31.260
We want to be able to put this Web site online but we also want people to be able to click on this and

00:31.470 --> 00:37.470
have a way to submit their email address so that maybe when your startup launches you can email them

00:37.560 --> 00:39.830
and ask them to make a purchase.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.270
So this is the fun part.

00:42.270 --> 00:46.920
Now that we've created the page how can we make it interactive.

00:47.430 --> 00:55.900
Well for this section we're going to use something called MailChimp and MailChimp is a e mail marketing

00:55.900 --> 00:56.630
service.

00:56.650 --> 01:04.540
There's other tools like Mailer lite and a ton of others that allow you to have this exact functionality

01:04.810 --> 01:11.170
a way for users to click on a button submit a form and save that information somewhere for you to use

01:11.170 --> 01:16.100
later now in order for this part to work.

01:16.200 --> 01:21.250
We need to create an account and sign up for free with MailChimp.

01:21.300 --> 01:27.840
Now I've already gone through the steps so you don't have to watch me type along but just a heads up

01:28.020 --> 01:31.970
what we're going to do it is completely free isn't going to cost you anything.

01:32.130 --> 01:40.390
But we do want to create an account with MailChimp so that we can create our email form so I want you

01:40.390 --> 01:42.400
to go ahead do this.

01:42.430 --> 01:48.790
It might ask you for your home address and that is actually a requirement especially in some parts of

01:48.790 --> 01:52.660
the world where to avoid spam and spam bots.

01:52.660 --> 01:59.590
You have to provide your home address or some sort of an address so that they know that you are a real

01:59.590 --> 02:06.300
human who is asking people to sign up to their newsletter but just go through the steps here.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.780
Just create your password get started.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.170
You might have to confirm your account with your e-mail.

02:12.370 --> 02:15.260
But it should take you no longer than five minutes.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.490
Once you have done that you can pause the video.

02:17.590 --> 02:22.340
Otherwise let's signing two million.

02:22.410 --> 02:28.530
Now one thing actually before we sign in is if you look at the pricing there is a free tier and this

02:28.530 --> 02:31.950
is where we're going to use where we can just create a form.

02:31.950 --> 02:37.150
And as long as we have less than two thousand contacts it's going to be completely free.

02:37.290 --> 02:42.660
Again if you're creating a startup landing page and you're getting more than 2000 people interested

02:42.900 --> 02:47.510
well then you're probably going to make some money so you can start paying for this service.

02:47.580 --> 02:51.720
But up until 2000 sign ups Well it's completely free.

02:51.720 --> 02:52.830
So that's really really nice.

02:53.710 --> 02:54.410
All right.

02:54.450 --> 02:58.070
Once you've created an account let's log in.

02:58.090 --> 02:58.780
All right.

02:58.780 --> 02:59.350
There we go.

02:59.350 --> 03:01.340
We have our dashboard now.

03:01.390 --> 03:08.410
I want you to keep in mind when you work with a service like this which is essentially a Web site online

03:08.710 --> 03:13.070
of a company they're always going to change how the Web site looks.

03:13.090 --> 03:18.160
So when you're watching this video you might not have the exact same look as I do.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.410
Don't worry about it.

03:19.450 --> 03:23.490
Most of the core functionalities are going to be the same.

03:23.530 --> 03:29.900
You might have just different buttons organized differently but what we want to do is essentially go

03:29.900 --> 03:39.460
to audience if you click on manage audience click on sign up forms.

03:39.630 --> 03:52.160
You can actually create your own audience so let's just call this 1 0 2 Mastery students.

03:52.280 --> 03:59.060
You can have different settings such as enabling captcha enabling double opt in which again sends contact

03:59.080 --> 04:00.140
opt in confirmation.

04:00.140 --> 04:07.090
So when people sign up they'll get a confirmation email that they've subscribed and you can also enable

04:07.100 --> 04:08.950
GDP fields.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.960
Now we don't need to worry about that too much.

04:12.110 --> 04:19.460
Let's create a form name named call it 0 2 mastery you can provide a default email address if you want

04:20.110 --> 04:26.540
scroll all the way down and you don't need to worry about too much let's just save audience and campaign

04:26.540 --> 04:27.590
defaults.

04:27.590 --> 04:28.010
All right.

04:28.070 --> 04:30.340
We've created our list.

04:30.450 --> 04:36.790
So now if I click back on audience you see that I have 0 2 Mastery students.

04:37.340 --> 04:45.190
If I go to campaigns now and say create campaign and instead of a sign out form we're going to click

04:45.190 --> 04:47.260
on landing page.

04:47.260 --> 04:49.680
Now the landing page name can be whatever you want.

04:49.720 --> 04:55.100
Let's say startup with an exclamation mark.

04:55.230 --> 04:58.620
We want to target the audience 0 2 Mastery students.

04:58.620 --> 05:07.230
We can click begin and here we can select a template that we want now in our case we can just have the

05:07.230 --> 05:15.910
grow your list template and you can customize this however you want.

05:15.950 --> 05:24.610
You can have different headings here such as this is the best business in the world.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.740
We can have a logo if you want.

05:29.460 --> 05:35.960
We can use the 0 2 mastery logo that I've already uploaded and we can just leave the email and subscriber

05:35.960 --> 05:36.890
or the way it is.

05:36.920 --> 05:43.280
Again this Web site is going to let you customize things differently and depending on when you watch

05:43.280 --> 05:46.390
the video these might be a little bit different.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.200
It doesn't really matter as long as we get this e-mail form.

05:49.670 --> 06:00.130
So if I click save and close and I go save and close we now have my startup page which I can just add

06:00.130 --> 06:04.300
a page title let's say startup idea

06:07.370 --> 06:15.970
we can add a U.R.L. so this allows you to have your own custom U.R.L. if you want.

06:16.040 --> 06:24.490
But in our case we want the free option so I can just create let's say Z team students and point so

06:24.530 --> 06:25.610
fight safe here.

06:26.540 --> 06:32.490
I now have a page Sholto a U.R.L. we have the audience which is 0 2 Mastery students.

06:32.660 --> 06:40.910
We have the content which is why we just created an all I need to do now is say publish high five.

06:40.980 --> 06:47.830
Thank you very much now your lending page is now live on the web right here.

06:48.550 --> 06:56.350
So check this out if I copy and paste this into the link there is my page.

06:56.350 --> 06:59.460
Now all we need to do is copy this link.

06:59.830 --> 07:07.950
Go to my find out more and make it so that when a user clicks on it it goes to that page and that's

07:07.950 --> 07:08.880
super easy right.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.110
We can just create an A tag with an H ref.

07:13.110 --> 07:17.420
And this H ref will have the link that we just copied.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.200
So let's close that

07:22.020 --> 07:26.210
close the 8:00 tag if I had save

07:29.070 --> 07:31.500
and refresh if I click.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.650
Now.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.980
How cool is that.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.820
But this isn't even the coolest part.

07:37.820 --> 07:41.740
The coolest part is now I can create just a random e-mail.

07:41.810 --> 07:50.180
Let's say one two three four Andy One two three four a G.M. dot com Click subscribe and oh we have almost

07:50.270 --> 07:51.290
finished.

07:51.290 --> 07:56.660
So you see over here how I got the you need to confirm your email address and that's because we clicked

07:56.660 --> 08:02.540
on that setting where people had to confirm their email address because while we don't want just anybody

08:02.540 --> 08:06.340
to sign up to our newsletter we want to make sure they're human and not just bots.

08:06.350 --> 08:15.970
So instead let's go back and actually give my email address subscribe find out go back to go to my email

08:17.140 --> 08:17.920
Hey check it out.

08:17.920 --> 08:18.460
Look at that.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.740
I have the 0 2 Mastery students.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.300
Yes.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.610
Subscribe me to the list.

08:24.790 --> 08:34.790
So if I click on this now I'm now subscribed to the list and if I go to my campaign's you'll see that

08:34.790 --> 08:38.210
I have two clicks on this campaign.

08:38.210 --> 08:50.530
So if I now actually go to view report I'll have a new subscriber that if I go to audience now you can

08:50.530 --> 08:54.760
see that I have a new contact and there we go.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.420
We have myself as the new subscriber.

08:58.540 --> 09:04.930
And as people get more and more interested in your startup they're going to sign up more and more and

09:04.990 --> 09:06.210
you'll be able to send them.

09:06.250 --> 09:13.830
And you know how cool is that let's take a break and I'll see you in the next video so that we can actually

09:13.830 --> 09:19.300
put this Web site online instead of just on our computers.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.000
I'll see you one by.
