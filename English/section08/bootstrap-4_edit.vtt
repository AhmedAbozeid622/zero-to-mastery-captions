00:01.940 --> 00:06.700
Let's start using Bootstrap. And there are two ways we can use this toolkit.

00:07.040 --> 00:16.150
One is to download and you can just click on the first link it says 'Compiled CSS and JS'.

00:16.230 --> 00:19.450
Well, let's just see what gets downloaded.

00:19.470 --> 00:26.160
So if I open this. You'll see here that I have a CSS file and JavaScript file.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.420
You see there's bunch of them.

00:28.610 --> 00:34.220
You don't have to worry too much about it is just different CSS files that are used together based

00:34.220 --> 00:39.800
on if you're using the Bootstrap grid or the Bootstrap CSS. And you'll see some of them have

00:39.800 --> 00:42.230
the 'Bootstrap.min.css'

00:42.320 --> 00:48.980
And that means that they are minified. So if I open this you'll see that everything is on one line and

00:49.160 --> 00:54.840
minified. Right now all we need to do is just add this to our project.

00:54.890 --> 00:59.260
But I want to show you a better way of doing it especially when we're getting started.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.220
And that is we can use something called a CDN.

01:03.230 --> 01:08.790
And so what is a CDN? A CDN is a Content Delivery Network.

01:09.080 --> 01:15.850
Bootstrap has this link and they're hosting the Bootstrap CSS files for us.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.210
So we don't even need to include it in our project.

01:18.260 --> 01:24.410
All we need to do is add this line into our HTML and you'll see here that the 'link' tag which refers

01:24.410 --> 01:32.000
to a stylesheet has an 'href' that links us to the Bootstrap minified CSS.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.650
And that's what a Content Delivery Network is.

01:33.650 --> 01:39.410
We don't need to include our files into our project we just link to someplace else that is actually

01:39.410 --> 01:40.470
hosting this file.

01:40.520 --> 01:47.960
So let's copy that. Open up Subline and I'm going to create a new file here and we'll save it to the

01:47.960 --> 01:52.360
desktop and we'll call it 'index.html'.

01:53.930 --> 01:58.890
I save. And let's open that up in the browser as well. OK.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.670
And empty because well we don't have any.

02:01.670 --> 02:06.910
Here, let's start with our html page and we'll title it '&lt;title&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/title&gt;'.

02:07.370 --> 02:16.660
And again we have that link copied which is the CDN that says hey I want the CSS file from Bootstrap.

02:16.710 --> 02:21.340
If you scroll down to the bottom it also has the JavaScript file.

02:21.450 --> 02:27.270
And like I said before, we need these files if we're using features of Bootstrap such as dropdowns or

02:27.270 --> 02:31.990
modals that actually add some actions to our websites.

02:32.250 --> 02:36.930
So let's just copy this and where we want to put JavaScript.

02:36.930 --> 02:41.750
And again when we get to that section in this course, we'll talk more about it.

02:41.790 --> 02:49.980
We want to put it at the bottom of our 'body' tag and that is because you want these JavaScript files to

02:49.980 --> 02:57.750
load after all the content of your websites have loaded. This way we have our website loaded and then

02:57.810 --> 02:59.270
the scripts get downloaded.

02:59.340 --> 03:04.740
If we put these at the top you'll have to wait for all of them to load before a user can see your website.

03:04.740 --> 03:07.810
And obviously that's that's not why we want to do. OK.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.140
And this is all we need to have

03:10.140 --> 03:12.370
Bootstrap working for us.

03:12.370 --> 03:13.590
So let's play with a few things.

03:13.590 --> 03:16.880
Let's say we wanted to add a navbar.

03:17.270 --> 03:25.950
I'll go into the 'Components' and select 'Navbar' and you can read about how it works but I really really

03:25.950 --> 03:29.060
like this navigation bar so I'm just going to copy the code.

03:32.280 --> 03:38.890
And add it to my 'body'. And I know it can get overwhelming when you're copying a whole bunch of code

03:39.330 --> 03:42.450
and you don't know exactly what it's doing.

03:42.720 --> 03:51.240
But if you actually read this line by line you know everything. It's just a few tags with their own specific

03:51.240 --> 03:52.510
Bootstrap classes.

03:52.620 --> 03:56.590
So let's save here and refresh. And look at that.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.660
We have a navigation bar.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.510
How easy is that.

04:01.530 --> 04:06.630
And one thing that Bootstrap is really famous for and why people love it so much is that it's

04:06.630 --> 04:08.520
 fully responsive so you see the menu bar here.

04:08.520 --> 04:17.100
If I make it bigger that it automatically changes according to what we need.

04:17.940 --> 04:20.460
OK. What else can we add over here.

04:20.460 --> 04:24.850
Let's look at, lets add a 'Jumbotron'.

04:25.030 --> 04:26.070
'Hello world'.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.360
I just can copy this.

04:29.490 --> 04:37.440
And again let's add that to - let's add that right below the navbar. So again, in Sublime Text I can minimize this

04:37.920 --> 04:48.900
by clicking the side over here, and below the navbar we'll add this Jumbotron.

04:49.040 --> 04:55.070
So if I save and refresh look at that. We have 'Hello, world!'.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.980
Let's add one last thing.

04:58.270 --> 05:03.290
We'll do a 'Modal'. And with the modal.

05:03.290 --> 05:04.400
I really like this one.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.630
'Launch demo model' (Live demo model).

05:05.670 --> 05:09.590
So I'm going to copy this (Live demo model).

05:09.670 --> 05:14.470
And again I'm going to minimize the Jumbotron just so we can see what we've added.

05:14.470 --> 05:15.870
Copy and paste this.

05:16.030 --> 05:23.450
Always have to adjust my indentation, perfect. And I save this and refresh.

05:23.450 --> 05:30.400
We have the launch demo model and if I click this [Launch demo modal]. Look at that, we have our own modal.

05:30.530 --> 05:34.880
Now. This. Just to prove that this is JavaScript.

05:35.110 --> 05:41.040
If I remove these scripts. I'm just going to comment them out,

05:41.050 --> 05:44.640
and I click this [Launch demo modal].
Nothing happens.

05:45.180 --> 05:48.900
And that's what JavaScript is doing. We'll

05:48.900 --> 05:49.960
get into it like I said, later.

05:50.070 --> 05:56.830
But there are some features that might not work with Bootstrap if you don't include these scripts.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.760
But if you're only using it for styles, then you might not even need these.

06:01.770 --> 06:09.710
So if I remove this if you saw we still have all of these. But the navbar isn't working anymore.

06:09.710 --> 06:12.680
So again you can play around and see why you need.

06:12.950 --> 06:18.740
You don't need to know exactly what these scripts do yet, so just leave them there for now.

06:18.740 --> 06:26.690
Now how can we change the style so that, you know. We can add our own custom look to our website.

06:26.800 --> 06:32.600
Well if we wanted to change something like the launch demo model button.

06:32.640 --> 06:40.800
Well in that case I can see over here that this is the 'button' and I can look at the classes that

06:40.800 --> 06:41.870
Bootstrap gives us.

06:42.210 --> 06:52.600
If I go into Buttons. Well here I can see that all these classes have, all these colors have different names

06:52.600 --> 06:58.780
so if I want it to be red I can use button 'Danger'.

06:58.780 --> 07:06.410
So again I can remove 'btn btn-primary' actually I can just type this out instead of primary.

07:06.500 --> 07:10.510
I can do 'btn btn-danger' save and refresh.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.880
And now the button is red.

07:13.030 --> 07:16.740
But again what if you want your own custom look to the button.

07:17.110 --> 07:19.180
Well that's easy to do.

07:19.180 --> 07:28.880
We can now say that from now on I want 'btn btn-danger' to be orange. The way we do that is create a

07:28.880 --> 07:32.630
stylesheet at the top.

07:32.710 --> 07:37.990
And now we can add our own stylesheet and you can see it's below the Bootstrap one which means that

07:38.040 --> 07:45.000
according to cascading style sheets, our styles will override anything that might match the Bootstrap ones.

07:45.010 --> 07:47.230
So let's create a 'style.css' file here.

07:48.430 --> 07:54.160
And I actually have one created already on our desktop you can see it over here, in the same directory

07:54.190 --> 07:56.320
as the index.html.

07:56.480 --> 08:09.030
And here we can say that the '.btn-danger' that we just added has a 'background-color:' of 'orange'.

08:09.070 --> 08:12.000
If I save this and refresh.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.560
Look at that. Our button is now orange and the hover effect is still red and that's the default Bootstrap

08:18.560 --> 08:23.760
so we can do '.btn-danger:hover'

08:27.230 --> 08:33.160
is going to be 'black'. Save and refresh. Look at that.

08:33.590 --> 08:35.500
We have our own custom button.

08:35.500 --> 08:42.240
You can see Bootstrap is very powerful we're able to create websites really really fast this way.

08:42.240 --> 08:48.630
And in the next section we're going to talk about the best feature of Bootstrap that I have yet

08:48.630 --> 08:49.570
 to tell you about.
