WEBVTT

00:01.350 --> 00:03.770
All right everybody let's keep going.

00:03.770 --> 00:09.610
What else can we do to this page to make it look more like this one.

00:09.620 --> 00:12.770
Well I want the text uppercase here.

00:12.860 --> 00:16.430
You can see over here that this is all in capitals.

00:16.430 --> 00:21.240
This is not I mean I could change this if I want to capital letters.

00:21.320 --> 00:29.930
I can also add a style to make everything uppercase but there's also a another useful one that comes

00:29.930 --> 00:31.180
with bootstrap.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.900
I can actually add a class

00:35.600 --> 00:46.190
and use a class and bootstrap called text dash uppercase if I save this and refresh.

00:46.190 --> 00:46.950
Look at that.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.350
Everything is upper case.

00:49.430 --> 00:50.730
That's awesome.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.120
Now what about the bun.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.290
Let's add some bootstrap styling to the buns again.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.610
Let's say you don't know how to add bootstrap styles or you don't know the classes.

01:01.610 --> 01:09.640
We can always go to the documentation and search funds.

01:09.660 --> 01:10.800
There we go.

01:10.800 --> 01:15.770
We see that we have some bonding classes that we can use in our case.

01:15.780 --> 01:16.910
Let's use this one.

01:16.990 --> 01:24.300
One primary so I'm going to copy comeback and with this button.

01:24.310 --> 01:29.050
Let's give it a class of 1 primary.

01:29.050 --> 01:36.040
If I save and refresh Hey look at that we have a bootstrap one already.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.110
That's really really cool.

01:38.110 --> 01:42.820
But you know what I want to have a different color right.

01:42.820 --> 01:45.840
I want the bun to look more like this.

01:45.970 --> 01:51.110
Something nicer so we can add our own custom CSX.

01:51.130 --> 01:54.000
Let's call this class bun.

01:54.310 --> 01:59.190
Max out for extra large button and this isn't a bootstrap class.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.410
If I save this and refresh nothing will happen.

02:02.470 --> 02:07.960
Instead we can create this button Excel right here in our own style sheet.

02:08.050 --> 02:19.430
So let's say bun or dot button tacks L is going to be let's make this a little bit bigger is going to

02:19.430 --> 02:26.300
have padding of let's say one hour yam on the sides and to our Yum.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.410
Top bottom.

02:27.710 --> 02:29.860
If I refreshes.

02:30.050 --> 02:30.970
That's better.

02:31.010 --> 02:31.880
That's a lot bigger.

02:31.880 --> 02:38.850
So we have an extra large but now we can add sizes or we can add different properties here.

02:38.990 --> 02:45.080
But since we named this class one excel we should just leave it the way it's describing things that

02:45.080 --> 02:54.790
is to make the bun larger so instead let's just modify the existing classes that we have which is the

02:54.790 --> 02:57.040
bun and bun primary.

02:57.130 --> 03:00.910
So if I go back here we can say that the bun.

03:01.100 --> 03:11.890
Class will have a font weight of let's say seven hundred and a border radius.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.980
That is to make the edges more circular.

03:14.980 --> 03:17.610
And we'll give it three hundred pixels.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.950
If I say this and refresh.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.060
Mm hmm.

03:21.070 --> 03:21.870
That's a lot better.

03:21.880 --> 03:22.600
I like that.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.950
And I want this capitalized as well and I could use the

03:29.560 --> 03:40.720
text uppercase class as we've seen before or I can just in here say text transform and just say uppercase.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.180
So just to use a CSX class five refresh.

03:44.180 --> 03:44.680
Mm hmm.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.450
That looks really really nice.

03:46.510 --> 03:47.530
Now let's keep going here.

03:47.560 --> 03:53.750
Let's add a another class here which is button primary.

03:53.920 --> 04:00.400
So we're just adding on to the bootstrap styles that we have and we'll just give it a background color

04:01.610 --> 04:02.900
of what should we do.

04:02.900 --> 04:11.330
Well if we go back to this page again we inspect right here by hovering and we click we see over here

04:11.330 --> 04:15.560
as we scroll down what color we're using over here.

04:15.560 --> 04:15.980
Let's see

04:21.480 --> 04:22.200
whereas the color.

04:22.230 --> 04:22.700
Let's see.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.580
Let's see.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.170
Oh there it is right here.

04:25.230 --> 04:32.610
So I'm going to copy the color added here if I hit save and refresh.

04:32.770 --> 04:33.610
Hey look at that.

04:33.630 --> 04:35.410
That's really really nice.

04:35.520 --> 04:41.670
But one thing you'll notice is that the border over here if we scroll or zoom in you see that the border

04:41.970 --> 04:53.250
has a bit of blue and that's default for the bootstrap theme so instead let's add a border as well.

04:53.470 --> 04:59.450
So call it border color and give it the same color.

04:59.450 --> 05:06.180
If I refresh that's much better although now we're hovering and it's turning blue.

05:06.270 --> 05:08.260
That's OK but I don't like it.

05:08.400 --> 05:14.650
Let's make it hover so it's still orange but maybe a little bit darker orange.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.130
So what can we do here.

05:16.170 --> 05:18.050
Again we've seen this before.

05:18.180 --> 05:31.420
We can just say button primary calling hover and in here we can just add background color to be something

05:31.450 --> 05:32.740
a little bit different than this.

05:32.740 --> 05:39.670
In this case we're going to use a color that is E for B 0 8.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.530
Don't worry I didn't memorize this.

05:41.530 --> 05:47.450
This is just something that while I knew that I used when I made this Web site first.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.900
So don't worry you never need to memorize hex colors.

05:50.930 --> 05:53.440
Next we'll do the same for the border color.

05:53.440 --> 05:58.160
So once again we'll make the border color the same as we have here.

05:58.170 --> 06:00.390
That's great.

06:00.410 --> 06:06.830
I also want to increase the border width actually to just make it a little bit bigger when we hover

06:06.830 --> 06:07.360
over it.

06:07.370 --> 06:16.390
So let's just give it an extra four pixels and let's say Phi refresh and hover and look at that.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.740
That's awesome so that's looking really really nice.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.640
So we have the button.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.960
It's looking pretty good.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.210
We have our header.

06:26.210 --> 06:28.330
That's looking pretty great as well.

06:28.340 --> 06:35.720
The other thing I want to add is this little line here just to give it a little extra flair to the page

06:36.680 --> 06:41.420
and we can use something called an H R here or a horizontal line.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.330
So the H R tag which we can just put in between.

06:45.410 --> 06:49.020
So let's say H R is a horizontal line.

06:49.260 --> 06:53.540
So if I refresh here I don't know if you can see it.

06:53.540 --> 06:54.710
Well because it's dark.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.490
But let's add some styling to it.

06:56.570 --> 07:07.450
So let's say in here that we want the chars on our page to have a border color of the orange that we've

07:07.450 --> 07:09.230
had before which is this one over here.

07:09.250 --> 07:15.510
So let's say border color is this fly safe and refreshed.

07:15.550 --> 07:15.940
All right.

07:15.940 --> 07:16.400
Look at that.

07:16.420 --> 07:18.070
There's our little line.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.790
It's a little thin though so let's add a bit of sizing.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.630
So I'll say border

07:25.170 --> 07:29.070
with and give it let's say three pixels.

07:29.070 --> 07:30.420
And if I refresh.

07:30.420 --> 07:30.760
All right.

07:30.780 --> 07:31.590
That's getting bigger.

07:31.590 --> 07:32.270
That's good.

07:32.340 --> 07:35.220
But I don't want this to be the entire page.

07:35.220 --> 07:38.910
I only want it a little bit just like we see it here.

07:41.760 --> 07:50.070
So we have a CSX property here that we can use called Max width which as the name suggests tells us

07:50.070 --> 07:53.870
exactly what's the maximum width of this thing.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.720
In our case let's say sixty five pixels.

07:57.750 --> 08:03.900
So if I say this and refresh that's much better all right.

08:03.980 --> 08:07.390
We're making progress here but there is an issue right.

08:07.400 --> 08:12.370
Right now we have the content that we want but it's all all over the place.

08:12.380 --> 08:13.670
It's kind of ugly isn't it.

08:13.670 --> 08:20.810
We want everything centered maybe around this laptop over here and this is where bootstrap really shines

08:21.860 --> 08:24.470
so let's figure that out in the next video.
