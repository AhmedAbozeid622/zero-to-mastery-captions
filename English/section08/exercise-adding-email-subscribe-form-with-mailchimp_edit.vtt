WEBVTT

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:02.620
All right everybody.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.039
This is the exciting part!

00:00:05.063 --> 00:00:09.903
Because up until now, well we've
created our startup landing page.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.030
It looks great but it's
only on our laptops.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.690
Right.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.809
If you're starting a business you're
not going to go to every customer.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.160
Give them your laptop and say "Hey
check out my startup landing page".

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.689
No we want to use the Internet right.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.060
We want to be able to
put this website online.

00:00:28.084 --> 00:00:30.984
But we also want people to
be able to click on this and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.370
have a way to submit their email address

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:37.454
so that maybe when your startup
launches you can email them

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.830
and ask them to make a purchase.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.269
So this is the fun part!

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.920
Now that we've created the page.
How can we make it interactive?

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.899
Well for this section we're going
to use something called MailChimp

00:00:53.223 --> 00:00:56.630
and MailChimp is an
e-mail marketing service.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.240
There's other tools like
MailerLite and a ton of others

00:01:01.264 --> 00:01:04.464
that allow you to have
this exact functionality

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.569
a way for users to click on a
button, submit a form

00:01:08.593 --> 00:01:11.874
and save that information
somewhere for you to use later.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.200
Now in order for this part to work

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.750
we need to create an account and
sign up for free with MailChimp.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.340
Now I've already gone through the steps
so you don't have to watch me type along

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.070
But just a heads up what we're
going to do it is completely free

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:32.094
isn't going to cost you anything.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.389
But we do want to create
an account with MailChimp.

00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:42.400
So that we can create our e-mail form.
So I want you to go ahead do this.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.189
It might ask you for your home address

00:01:45.213 --> 00:01:48.713
and that is actually a requirement
especially in some parts of

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.659
the world where to avoid
spam and spam bots.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.389
You have to provide your home address

00:01:55.413 --> 00:01:59.913
or some sort of an address so that
they know that you are a real human

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.100
who is asking people to
sign up to their newsletter.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.124
But just go through the steps here.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.780
Just create your password get started.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.170
You might have to confirm
your account with your e-mail.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.260
But it should take you no
longer than five minutes.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.490
Once you have done that
you can pause the video.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.540
Otherwise let's sign-in to MailChimp.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.029
Now one thing actually before we
sign-in is if you look at the pricing

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.949
there is a free tier and this is where we're
going to use where we can just create a form.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.150
And as long as we have less than 2000
contacts it's going to be completely free.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.660
Again if you're creating a startup landing page and
you're getting more than 2000 people interested

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.510
well then you're probably going to make some
money so you can start paying for this service.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.719
But up until 2000 sign ups,
well it's completely free.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.880
So that's really really nice.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.410
All right.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.570
Once you've created an
account let's log in.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.780
All right.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.350
There we go.

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:01.040
We have our dashboard.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.110
Now I want you to keep in mind when
you work with a service like this

00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:09.734
which is essentially a
website online of a company

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.070
they're always going to
change how the website looks.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.159
So when you're watching this video you
might not have the exact same look as I do.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.410
Don't worry about it.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.490
Most of the core functionalities
are going to be the same.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.299
You might have just different
buttons organized differently.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.060
But what we want to do is
essentially go to audience.

00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:37.984
If you click on manage audience
click on sign up forms.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.160
You can actually create your own audience.

00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:49.284
So let's just call this one
"Zero to Mastery students".

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.860
You can have different settings such as
enabling captcha, enabling double opt-in

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.929
which again sends contact
opt-in confirmation.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.290
So when people sign up they'll
get a confirmation e-mail

00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:08.950
that they've subscribed and you
can also enable GDPR fields.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.960
Now we don't need to
worry about that too much.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.160
Let's create a form name named
call it "Zero to Mastery".

00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:19.784
You can provide a default
e-mail address if you want.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.539
Scroll all the way down.

00:04:21.563 --> 00:04:27.589
And you don't need to worry about too much let's
just save audience and campaign defaults.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.010
All right.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.340
We've created our list.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.090
So now if I click back on audience.

00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:37.214
You see that I have "Zero
to Mastery students".

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.189
If I go to campaigns now
and say create campaign

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:47.259
and instead of a sign-up form we're
going to click on landing page.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.680
Now the landing page name
can be whatever you want.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.100
Let's say "Startup" with
an exclamation mark.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.619
We want to target the audience
"Zero to Mastery students".

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.229
We can click begin

00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:04.453
and here we can select
a template that we want.

00:05:04.477 --> 00:05:09.277
Now in our case we can just
have the grow your list template

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.910
and you can customize
this however you want.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:24.610
You can have different headings here such as
"This is the best business in the world!".

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.740
We can have a logo if you want.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.059
We can use the Zero to Mastery
logo that I've already uploaded.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:36.890
And we can just leave the email
and subscriber the way it is.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.379
Again this website is going to let
you customize things differently

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.190
and depending on when you watch the video
these might be a little bit different.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.200
It doesn't really matter as
long as we get this e-mail form.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.129
So if I click save and close
and I go save and close.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:05.000
We now have my startup page which I can just
add a page title let's say "Startup Idea".

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.170
We can add a URL.

00:06:10.694 --> 00:06:15.954
So this allows you to have your
own custom URL if you want.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.490
But in our case we want the free
option so I can just create let's say

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:25.610
"ztmstudents" and point so
if I save here.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.490
I now have a page title, a URL, we have the
audience which is "Zero to Mastery students"

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.110
we have the content which is what we just created.
And all I need to do now is say publish.

00:06:38.934 --> 00:06:40.934
High five!

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:47.830
Thank you very much. Now your landing
page is now live on the web right here.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:56.049
So check this out if I copy and paste
this into the link there is my page.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.060
Now all we need to do is copy this link.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.049
Go to my find out more.

00:07:02.173 --> 00:07:07.873
And make it so that when a user
clicks on it it goes to that page.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.150
And that's super easy, right.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.109
We can just create an
"a" tag with an "href".

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.420
And this "href" will have
the link that we just copied.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.200
So let's close that

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.510
close the "a" tag.

00:07:25.034 --> 00:07:26.534
If I hit save

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.650
and refresh if I click now.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.980
How cool is that!

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.819
But this isn't even the coolest part.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.740
The coolest part is now I can
create just a random e-mail.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.180
Let's say "andy1234@gmail.com".

00:07:46.204 --> 00:07:51.289
Click subscribe and oh
we have almost finished.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.259
So you see over here how I got the
you need to confirm your email address

00:07:55.283 --> 00:08:00.359
and that's because we clicked on that setting
where people had to confirm their email address

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.080
because well we don't want just
anybody to sign up to our newsletter

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.340
we want to make sure they're
human and not just bots.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:12.070
So instead let's go back and
actually give my email address.

00:08:12.094 --> 00:08:16.194
Subscribe
if I now go back to go to my email.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.519
Hey check it out!
Look at that!

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.740
I have the "Zero to Mastery students".

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.610
Yes, subscribe me to the list.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.189
So if I click on this now I'm
now subscribed to the list

00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:32.213
and if I go to my campaigns.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.209
You'll see that I have two
clicks on this campaign.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.929
So if I now actually go to view report

00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:48.753
I'll have a new subscriber
that if I go to audience now

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.759
you can see that I have a
new contact and there we go.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.420
We have myself as the new subscriber.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.230
And as people get more and
more interested in your startup

00:09:01.754 --> 00:09:04.154
they're going to sign up more and more

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.510
and you'll be able to send them an email.

00:09:07.011 --> 00:09:09.225
How cool is that!

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.929
Let's take a break and I'll
see you in the next video

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:19.300
so that we can actually put this website
online instead of just on our computers.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.000
I'll see you on that one. Bye bye.
