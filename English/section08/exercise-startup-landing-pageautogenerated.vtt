Holy moly.

00:02.190 --> 00:04.230
Good job getting this far in the course.

00:04.230 --> 00:09.960
You should really really be proud of yourself because we've learned a lot and now we're gonna build

00:09.960 --> 00:11.570
something really exciting.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.240
We're gonna build a start up landing page.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.170
A landing page like this.

00:16.170 --> 00:24.120
That well is responsive but most importantly it has some text.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.100
It has a button.

00:25.590 --> 00:26.500
But check this out.

00:26.580 --> 00:32.270
When you click on the button it takes you to a form to sign up and collect email addresses.

00:32.280 --> 00:32.920
That's right.

00:32.970 --> 00:35.790
We're building a start up landing page.

00:35.790 --> 00:40.620
I'm going to show you how to do it step by step and you can grab the starter files attached to this

00:40.620 --> 00:47.970
lesson because we're gonna build this from scratch and see how we can put something online that you

00:47.970 --> 00:49.590
can now share with your friends.

00:49.590 --> 00:53.540
Next time you have a big start up idea let's get started.
