00:02.900 --> 00:11.030
And we'll go to the super slim option and just copy and paste this block of text that they provide for

00:11.030 --> 00:20.710
us and this is actually html and also if we go back to our webpage I can now, Right above my button, paste

00:20.860 --> 00:22.350
this piece of coding.

00:22.810 --> 00:28.680
And you see that they've commented it out for us so that we know that this isn't our code.

00:28.690 --> 00:36.210
It is the MailChimp signup form. So if we refresh this. If I save and refresh.

00:36.250 --> 00:39.280
Well, we kind of get this ugly thing over here.

00:39.280 --> 00:46.840
We don't really want anything but the 'Subscribe' cause if I click 'Subscribe' it'll actually open us to this

00:46.960 --> 00:53.740
pop up. So let's get rid of some of this stuff. We see over here that the email address - If I look over

00:53.740 --> 00:56.270
here I see the 'input type ="email" '.

00:56.470 --> 00:58.810
We don't need that so we'll remove it.

00:59.470 --> 01:00.190
OK.

01:00.430 --> 01:06.160
We also see here that we don't really want this background to be white like this.

01:06.400 --> 01:16.170
And you can see over here that they've made the 'background:#fff;' so we can remove that and refresh. 

01:16.170 --> 01:20.760
Perfect. We also don't want this text so I'm going to remove this 'label... /label'.

01:20.770 --> 01:27.390
You can see here that it's written 'Subscribe to our mailing list'. Perfect, and refresh.

01:27.750 --> 01:28.420
OK.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.780
Now we want this button [Subscribe] to actually be this button [Find out more].

01:31.840 --> 01:33.020
So how can we do that?

01:33.220 --> 01:38.690
We can find this button by again looking at the 'input type="submit" value="Subscribe" '

01:38.760 --> 01:39.890
That looks like the button.

01:40.060 --> 01:47.980
Let's make this instead of the 'input' to be the button. The way we do that is we just give it the class

01:48.160 --> 01:49.970
that we have for the button [class="btn btn-primary-btn-xl"].

01:50.470 --> 01:51.640
So let's try that.

01:51.700 --> 01:56.300
I go over here and just add the class [class="btn btn-primary-btn-xl"] and I remove my 'button... /button'

02:00.720 --> 02:03.440
Let's save and refresh.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.940
Look at that.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.170
We have our button but it changed our text so make sure you remember to change back your text to 'Find out more'.

02:12.170 --> 02:16.310
Save and refresh.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.220
Look at that.

02:18.330 --> 02:25.500
And now if we click on this. I can enter a fake email address.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.920
I'll say 'Is it working?'.

02:29.030 --> 02:29.820
Hi.

02:30.030 --> 02:36.930
And subscribe to the list. And I got to confirm I'm not a human or I am a human.

02:36.950 --> 02:40.690
Click 'Subscribe to list' and you'll get a confirmation here.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.150
And this is the cool part.

02:42.170 --> 02:49.270
Now if I go back to MailChimp. Let's make this larger and I go to 'Lists'.

02:49.440 --> 03:01.170
I click on test. Look at that. I have collected an email address and here you can manage your users and

03:01.170 --> 03:04.730
find out who's interested in your startup and it's working.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.560
How awesome is that?

03:06.570 --> 03:12.050
So there you have it. You've created your first startup landing page.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.930
See if you can implement this on your own website.

03:14.970 --> 03:19.120
As you can see it's fairly easy and it has nice comments for you.

03:19.170 --> 03:20.380
So there you have it.

03:20.400 --> 03:27.360
We have this piece of MailChimp code that does all this magic for you and you don't really need to know

03:27.360 --> 03:28.740
exactly how it works.

03:28.830 --> 03:35.700
You can look into it and read up on it but it's just a simple form that gets triggered when you click

03:35.700 --> 03:36.260
on a button.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.580
So that can have sign ups.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.230
All right.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.890
Go off and launch your next startup idea.

03:42.950 --> 03:44.720
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
