WEBVTT

00:01.070 --> 00:01.490
All right.

00:01.580 --> 00:06.510
Let's get going here now the first thing we want to do is change this hello to.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.920
Well the biggest startup event of the year.

00:09.950 --> 00:10.790
Very dramatic.

00:10.790 --> 00:11.140
I know.

00:11.490 --> 00:12.260
So let's do that.

00:12.290 --> 00:21.280
I'm just going to say the biggest startup event of the year.

00:21.290 --> 00:21.770
That's right.

00:22.010 --> 00:22.410
OK.

00:22.460 --> 00:24.170
Let's save.

00:24.170 --> 00:30.440
So I'm doing command s or if you're on Windows control s and then refresh command are or if you're on

00:30.440 --> 00:34.340
Windows control are all right.

00:34.370 --> 00:35.180
There we go.

00:35.180 --> 00:36.260
That's great.

00:36.260 --> 00:39.640
We also seem to have a button that says find out more.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.310
So let's do that as well.

00:41.330 --> 00:43.890
We'll say button.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.600
Find out more.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.080
There we go.

00:48.950 --> 00:50.570
If I refresh here.

00:50.690 --> 00:51.390
There you go.

00:51.380 --> 00:57.410
Our startup landing page is well frankly still looking fairly ugly now.

00:57.440 --> 01:05.490
The next thing we want to do is we want to have this background image but before we get to that I want

01:05.490 --> 01:13.020
to talk a little bit about how we can set up our HMO page so that we have good responsive design.

01:13.050 --> 01:15.540
So right now nothing much is going on.

01:15.540 --> 01:23.990
You can see here that I can adjust the screen size but we don't have much happening on our page so if

01:23.990 --> 01:30.530
we go back to the bootstrap documentation in the quick start guide if I scroll all the way to the bottom

01:31.040 --> 01:36.110
you see that I get a starter template here and you might notice here something that we haven't seen

01:36.110 --> 01:45.080
before which is this part over here called a required med attack and you can see here that this is actually

01:45.590 --> 01:50.870
something that we can copy and paste and place right below our title here.

01:51.110 --> 01:51.720
Just like that.

01:52.460 --> 01:57.630
Now let's make this a little bit bigger so we can see and I'll make the writing smaller just so you

01:57.630 --> 02:00.540
can see over here exactly what's happening.

02:00.540 --> 02:10.730
So this meta tag allows us to add new information to our EMR page and there's different things that

02:10.850 --> 02:12.300
we can provide.

02:12.410 --> 02:19.370
Now in most Web sites you'll actually see these two lines very often as a matter of fact it's recommended

02:19.400 --> 02:21.550
that you always add.

02:21.560 --> 02:30.400
Now what exactly do they do well if we scroll down here you'll see that we have the responsive Medtech

02:32.260 --> 02:32.920
essentially.

02:32.950 --> 02:41.920
This line here which says viewport allows us to create web pages that are developed mobile first.

02:41.980 --> 02:50.590
That is we let the page know or the browser know that this page should work on mobile devices and things

02:50.590 --> 02:59.130
like scrolling or touching or zooming on a mobile device is going to work with this that.

02:59.300 --> 03:04.130
Now this is something I'm going to leave for you to learn more about and it's something we'll talk about

03:04.130 --> 03:13.130
later in the course but these med attacks are just useful things to add to our projects anytime we create

03:13.160 --> 03:13.940
a new page.

03:13.970 --> 03:20.750
And then finally this top med attack uses UTF 8 encoding essentially it's saying hey we're going to

03:20.750 --> 03:28.490
use this form of encoding to write text on our pages again something that if you're curious you can

03:28.580 --> 03:36.020
read up on your own but now that we've set this up so that it's good for mobile as well.

03:36.030 --> 03:43.940
Let's try to include this background image into our page now when it comes to background images on a

03:43.940 --> 03:50.570
Web site that's a very common thing you'll see a lot of people adding background images to a Web site

03:50.750 --> 03:59.380
or maybe patterns or some sort of colors and when a common problem happens I always like well Googling

03:59.920 --> 04:06.430
and one of the first things that you'll encounter is this perfect full page background image by CSL

04:06.440 --> 04:08.840
Citrix which we've seen before.

04:09.100 --> 04:17.020
Now if you scroll all the way down it tells us a way for us to make sure that we use the image in a

04:17.020 --> 04:25.610
full page background so that it stretches it flexes as the view port changes now over here.

04:25.610 --> 04:29.930
It actually gives us a copy and paste way that we can use it ourselves.

04:30.470 --> 04:43.040
So I'm going to just copy this go to my style page and just add this to our CSX now you'll see over

04:43.040 --> 04:47.270
here that we're using background over here with the your well.

04:47.270 --> 04:55.350
So we want to adjust it to header dodge a peg because that's the U.R.L. of the header and the key here

04:55.350 --> 05:03.270
is these lines saying hey we don't want to repeat the image we want you to keep it centered and we want

05:03.270 --> 05:04.660
you to keep it fixed.

05:04.710 --> 05:13.840
And by using this line it stretches or at least it fills the entire page with our image and as long

05:13.840 --> 05:17.850
as we have background size as cover.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.190
Well let's see what happens.

05:19.210 --> 05:23.120
I'm going to refresh Hey and look at that.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.390
Now I have this image

05:28.290 --> 05:37.350
adapts to our page but the cool part is if I open the developer tools here let's say view developer

05:37.800 --> 05:46.390
tools you'll notice that the image actually bumps up so that the center of the image wall is always

05:46.600 --> 05:47.780
centered.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.540
How cool is that.

05:49.540 --> 05:57.730
So this is a very useful trick to have your background very flexible.

05:57.750 --> 05:57.960
All right.

05:57.960 --> 06:04.470
So we have our background unfortunately our writing right now is hard to see the button still kind of

06:04.470 --> 06:05.130
ugly.

06:05.220 --> 06:09.160
So let's fix a few things in our Asian male page.

06:09.220 --> 06:12.940
Now remember we have bootstrapped so we can start using some bootstrap classes.

06:12.940 --> 06:22.930
Now one thing that I want to do is with this H1 tat I want to maybe use a strong element to emphasize

06:24.500 --> 06:26.840
the header.

06:26.840 --> 06:31.370
So make sure we close this and I'm gonna make this bigger just so you can see.

06:31.590 --> 06:36.790
And if I refresh all right that's emphasized a little bit more.

06:36.790 --> 06:43.630
We also want to make sure that this h1 tag we can actually see so we can go into our style and just

06:43.630 --> 06:50.860
create a new H1 style that will have a let's say a font size

06:55.360 --> 06:56.780
of let's say three.

06:56.980 --> 06:57.700
Ah yeah.

06:57.820 --> 07:03.850
And then we'll give it a color of what should we do here.

07:03.850 --> 07:10.680
Well one thing that I always like to do when I'm trying to figure out what color I want is to go to

07:10.680 --> 07:16.700
a page let's say like the startup over here open up the developer tools

07:20.010 --> 07:26.310
make sure this is a little bit bigger so we can see and then find somewhere on the page where you have

07:26.310 --> 07:32.830
this color palette if I actually click on this and I'm on Chrome look at that it opens up a little color

07:32.830 --> 07:42.770
palette for us so I can actually move around things and grab the hacks of the color that I want in our

07:42.770 --> 07:48.270
case I want the color to be well let's find out how can I copy the color of this page.

07:48.410 --> 07:51.260
I can just click on select an element.

07:51.290 --> 07:53.240
This little icon here.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.390
And then if I hover over this look at that.

07:56.480 --> 08:00.330
It shows me exactly what color this element has.

08:00.350 --> 08:02.810
You can see over here that this is the hex color.

08:03.110 --> 08:07.730
So I'm just going to copy that come back and paste it in.

08:07.850 --> 08:13.530
Now if I save both of these files and refresh that's much better.

08:13.570 --> 08:14.290
I like that a lot.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.440
All right.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.060
We're making progress with our page.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.710
It's getting closer but we still have a lot to do.

08:20.710 --> 08:22.990
So let's take a break and I'll see you in the next video.
