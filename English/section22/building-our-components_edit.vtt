WEBVTT

00:01.050 --> 00:03.700
All right, it's time to get started on this.

00:03.840 --> 00:09.540
The very first thing I like doing is, imagining what we're going to build and trying to separate out

00:09.540 --> 00:13.530
the components of our application.

00:14.190 --> 00:20.050
So I did a quick wireframe here, of what we want our project to look.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.020
We want to have some sort of a logo.

00:23.110 --> 00:31.120
We want to have a user's name, displayed with their rank and this rank is going to correspond to how many

00:31.120 --> 00:36.160
face detections they've done, compared to all the other users.

00:36.160 --> 00:40.000
So we're going to want some sort of a sign in and sign out feature.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.970
So this is the home page.

00:41.980 --> 00:49.270
But if they click sign out, they'll be signed out, and in order to sign in, there will be a sign in form.

00:51.510 --> 00:57.120
We have a url input here, where we can enter url for an image.

00:57.120 --> 01:06.060
If we click detect, then it will display the image with the face detection, on hopefully the face.

01:06.300 --> 01:13.570
And we obviously want it to be responsive, but looking at this, if I was going to divide this into components,

01:13.600 --> 01:21.960
I see that there is a navigation component, there is maybe a user info, maybe rank component, there's

01:22.010 --> 01:24.850
a logo component of some sort.

01:25.010 --> 01:28.290
There's an input form component.

01:28.340 --> 01:33.810
There is an image component. And possibly within that a(an)

01:33.830 --> 01:38.580
another component that does the image detection.

01:38.660 --> 01:44.890
OK, so I think, the first step that we can do is to start building out these components, using create react

01:44.890 --> 01:52.050
app and the sign in and registration form is maybe something that we can work on afterwards.

01:52.090 --> 01:54.190
All right so let's minimize this.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.270
So, I've actually just ran create react app,

01:58.420 --> 02:01.720
I called this project face recognition brain.

02:01.930 --> 02:06.780
You can do the same as well but as you can see I haven't changed anything if I do 'npm start'

02:10.650 --> 02:14.640
I have the skeleton of what 'create react app' gives us.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.150
All right to start off, I'm going to start removing some of the things that I don't need,

02:24.150 --> 02:27.440
I know, that I don't need their logo so I'm gonna

02:29.450 --> 02:32.060
delete that, OK.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.610
And then, if we go to app.js

02:33.850 --> 02:41.520
and we could just remove the logo, and we can just remove everything that's inside here.

02:41.710 --> 02:45.120
So we're left with just a 'div' with the 'classname' "App".

02:45.610 --> 02:49.990
And let's just build out some components even though we haven't created them, let's just build them as

02:50.010 --> 02:51.680
so we have them in our heads.

02:51.820 --> 02:54.450
We have a 'Navigation' component.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.960
That's where we have this sign out.

02:58.070 --> 03:01.840
We have a 'Logo' component.

03:03.340 --> 03:06.090
That will create.

03:06.120 --> 03:20.190
We also have perhaps an 'ImageLinkForm' that's our input form, and then finally, we have our 

03:20.850 --> 03:26.360
'FaceRecognition' which will be the image with the face recognition on it.

03:26.430 --> 03:31.240
Looking at these four components, I think we can build them fairly fast.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.940
So let's start to do that.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.020
I'm going to actually comment out, I'm going to wrap these in a curly bracket, so that it's a javascript

03:40.020 --> 03:46.490
expression, and then comment them out in the standard javascript way.

03:46.740 --> 03:52.920
So we can start off with navigation. As we know, because this project is going to get a little big.

03:52.950 --> 03:59.790
We're going to just create a new folder, we'll call it components, and within these components we'll create

03:59.790 --> 04:04.330
a new folder and we'll call it navigation.

04:05.010 --> 04:09.510
And this navigation folder will have anything related to our navigation component.

04:09.510 --> 04:15.420
So that is CSS, javascript, in our cases just javascript for now, so we'll just do

04:15.460 --> 04:18.020
navigation dot js(navigation.js).

04:18.040 --> 04:21.580
All right, we have our file all set up now.

04:22.460 --> 04:29.600
So in here, we do the standard 'import React from react'

04:33.080 --> 04:36.380
and it's going to be a simple component with no states.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.960
So again we can just do, a pure function,

04:44.820 --> 04:46.500
and it won't accept any parameters

04:46.500 --> 04:56.290
for now, we'll just simply return, just do something like a 'nav' and this navigation because we're working

04:56.290 --> 05:00.310
on our home screen for now, we're just going to have a 'p' tag

05:03.690 --> 05:06.200
that says 'Sign out',

05:10.700 --> 05:19.670
and we obviously wanna 'export default Navigation', save that, let's go back here

05:19.670 --> 05:20.290
and import that now.

05:20.480 --> 05:26.680
So we'll do 'import Navigation' from current directory(./).

05:26.790 --> 05:33.390
wanna access the Components folder navigation then navigation dot js, we don't need to put the

05:33.390 --> 05:47.060
js at the end. Save that. Oh! and I have capital components, should be lowercase and it should be thus.

05:47.060 --> 05:53.240
Let's go back, we have a nice little sign, don't worry, it's going to start looking much better than that.

05:53.330 --> 05:57.040
We want this to actually display on the right hand side.

05:57.260 --> 06:02.400
So a nice simple way of doing that, we can just add a 'style' attribute for now.

06:03.950 --> 06:13.610
And again, we're passing it on an object and we'll just say, the 'display' will be 'flex' and 'justify' and

06:13.760 --> 06:15.870
remember, because this is a javascript object,

06:15.920 --> 06:16.880
we can do this,

06:16.880 --> 06:24.390
it's camel case. So (justify)Content and react you just use camel case any time you need to use a dash, to

06:24.410 --> 06:28.470
'justifyContent', will be 'flex-end',

06:28.600 --> 06:36.220
so it's at the end to the right. Save this, and it's to the right, you need a bit of padding but for now

06:36.580 --> 06:38.080
that's fine.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.390
And you know what, looking at this, I have a feeling, we're going to need some CSS.

06:42.400 --> 06:48.430
So I'm going to install 'tachyons' here, so that you don't have to worry too much about CSS and I can just

06:48.430 --> 06:55.510
give you the 'tachyons' properties, because again, CSS is something that is very dependent on the specific

06:55.510 --> 06:57.780
project and because we've already covered it,

06:57.820 --> 06:59.710
we don't want to spend too much time on it.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.690
So using 'tachyons', I'm just going to use there, Oops!,

07:04.270 --> 07:05.610
I got to install it.

07:06.100 --> 07:06.900
Let's clear this,

07:12.630 --> 07:21.960
and this way when we go to app dot js, we can just or in our index dot js, we can just import 'tachyons'.

07:27.120 --> 07:33.780
Perfect, so using 'tachyons', I'm going to start styling this, and you can just pause the video and copy

07:33.780 --> 07:39.130
and paste this, if you want on your project or grab the project files, afterwards.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.490
So based on size, I'll do that.

07:41.490 --> 07:43.080
It's going to be a link.

07:43.230 --> 07:46.960
It's going 'dim', when I click on it will be black.

07:47.220 --> 07:53.030
It's going to be underlined, padding of three and pointer,

07:53.130 --> 07:57.230
when we hover over. Kind of reads nicely with 'tachyons'.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.400
I'm a big fan of them. Let's do 'npm start'

08:05.860 --> 08:06.750
All right, look at that.

08:06.770 --> 08:14.270
That's a lot better all ready. And you know what? when we look at this white screen,

08:14.280 --> 08:17.150
it's kind of discouraging and feels like we haven't done much.

08:17.220 --> 08:24.450
So let's add a nice background, so that again we're look, we're making a bit of progress and we're now

08:24.450 --> 08:25.800
looking at a blank screen.

08:26.130 --> 08:31.360
Even though styling is not the most important in an app, I do like having a bit of progress when we start a

08:31.380 --> 08:35.120
projects, just for that confidence boost.

08:35.270 --> 08:39.100
So in index dot css,

08:39.290 --> 08:44.900
I'm going to add a background to family and this is a gradient that I really really like so I'm just

08:44.900 --> 08:46.640
going to copy and paste it here.

08:46.730 --> 08:49.460
You can find your own gradient and decide what is good for you.

08:50.330 --> 08:55.340
I'm gonna save that, see we're just using linear gradient.

08:55.510 --> 08:57.880
Look at that, that's already much better to look at.

08:59.870 --> 09:05.120
All right, so navigation, from what I can see, it's pretty much all we want for now.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.930
We don't need to add any functionality, we're just building the skeleton.

09:09.090 --> 09:17.470
So let's move to building the input. So the input, we call that the 'ImageLink Form'.

09:17.490 --> 09:24.960
Oh! actually let's do the 'Logo' first because I see it here, and I put the comments out here. Again,

09:24.980 --> 09:26.680
we're going to do the same thing.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.550
So I'm just going to copy and paste this,

09:31.920 --> 09:41.550
and we'll just say 'Logo' from 'components/logo' and 'logo.js', we're just going to create a new folder

09:41.550 --> 09:42.380
again.

09:44.650 --> 09:52.080
And within that we'll have new file, 'Logo.js'.

09:52.210 --> 09:58.420
And by the way, if you're getting sick and tired of constantly clicking javascript, then making sure that

09:58.980 --> 10:03.370
'Babel' is the default instead of the regular javascript, so you can see jsx

10:03.370 --> 10:11.950
Well, if you go to views in sublime, and then go to syntax, you can do, 'open all with current extension as...'

10:11.980 --> 10:16.400
'Bable' javascript and this way every time you open a javascript file,

10:16.420 --> 10:20.130
well, this will be the default extension.

10:20.150 --> 10:22.800
All right, with the logo you don't want to make things fast.

10:22.800 --> 10:32.370
I'm just going to copy the navigation, paste it in here, and I'm just going to change 'Navigation' to 'Logo'

10:33.480 --> 10:37.340
And obviously we going want to return something different.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.190
So will say, this one will have a 'div',

10:43.020 --> 10:48.900
and will give it a 'className' again using 'tachyons', some margins, that are nice.

10:48.930 --> 10:51.210
And that's margin top to zero.

10:54.180 --> 10:59.220
And then for the logo, we have nothing yet, but I wanna show you this cool library that I found which

10:59.220 --> 11:03.850
is 'react-tilt', and it actually allows you to create,

11:06.470 --> 11:09.670
something like this.

11:09.980 --> 11:18.590
It can hover and tilt around. Again, beauty of 'react' and 'npm' is that you can use these packages to

11:19.160 --> 11:22.700
make your project go a little bit nicer.

11:22.730 --> 11:29.210
So I'm going just copy this command, 'npm install dash dash save react-tilt', and in case you're wondering

11:29.210 --> 11:29.720
what,

11:32.760 --> 11:43.440
what the dash dash(--) save is? before in the earlier versions of 'npm', if you wanted to have, the package installed

11:43.560 --> 11:45.300
on 'package dot json'(package.json)

11:45.420 --> 11:48.530
and the dependencies you had to do '--save'.

11:48.570 --> 11:53.680
Now it does it by default, so you don't have to the 'dash dash save'(--save) anymore and you can see that

11:53.730 --> 11:57.490
'react-tilt' and 'tachyons' is in our package.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.970
Alright, let's start that back.

12:02.750 --> 12:09.860
And, if we go to the documentation here, it actually gives you, exactly what you need.

12:09.870 --> 12:13.780
You just import, 'tilt' from 'react-tilt'.

12:13.940 --> 12:17.730
So we'll do that.

12:17.770 --> 12:26.260
So we have the 'tilt' component now, and we just copy and paste this 'Tilt' component,

12:29.710 --> 12:31.210
that they've created for us.

12:31.270 --> 12:37.780
Again the power and being a web developer and just overall in general, it's nice to be able to use things

12:37.780 --> 12:42.760
that people have built, and also be able to share things that you've created. So you can create your own

12:42.760 --> 12:49.510
'react-component' that other people can use and it makes things as I said before, more reusable.

12:49.510 --> 12:51.250
So looking at this everything is good.

12:51.250 --> 12:57.560
I'm going to change the height and width, maybe a little bit smaller, and for now we'll have this alien

12:57.560 --> 13:05.190
figure, although we're probably going to change it with our/to our own logo, but I'm going to save this

13:06.440 --> 13:08.270
and we get our narrowboat emojis.

13:08.350 --> 13:09.730
But it's fine for now.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.410
If I go back.

13:11.510 --> 13:14.440
All right it's looking a little bit off.

13:14.450 --> 13:18.040
Let's see, what's going on here.

13:18.090 --> 13:23.210
So, if we go to 'Logo', let's just add some 'tachyons',

13:23.680 --> 13:31.310
I see the 'border radius two(br2)' and 'shadow-2', so this way I can see, more clearly, where it is.

13:31.350 --> 13:31.990
OK.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.500
All right. So it's working,

13:33.660 --> 13:38.330
but our colors are a bit off it looks like we need to added some background, for this.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.840
But look at that, it's already working nicely.

13:41.930 --> 13:44.440
So I'm going to create a new file,

13:44.450 --> 13:49.280
'logo.css', and we're going to make the background

13:51.910 --> 13:58.610
sort of using the 'Tilt' class name, so we can just piggyback on that to say 'Tilt'

14:03.730 --> 14:09.070
and I'm going to use the same background as we have in our 'index.css' file,

14:09.070 --> 14:11.860
just because I think it looks nice, I'm going to copy that,

14:14.880 --> 14:22.350
put the same 'background' in here, and the only thing we need to do is just 'import'

14:26.120 --> 14:27.790
'Logo dot css(Logo.css)'

14:30.650 --> 14:33.700
from the current directory(./).

14:33.740 --> 14:34.880
Let's check that out.

14:34.910 --> 14:35.880
Look at that.

14:36.020 --> 14:36.900
That looks great.

14:37.790 --> 14:43.760
So one of the cool things you can do with 'Tilt' is that, you can add it a few options based on what you

14:43.760 --> 14:44.670
want to do.

14:44.780 --> 14:47.200
So you can read through this yourself.

14:47.630 --> 14:50.790
But, I kind of want this to be more exaggerated a bit.

14:51.750 --> 14:57.060
And we can do that by just changing the max to something a little bit higher, if I save that,

15:03.220 --> 15:03.570
all right,

15:03.570 --> 15:10.130
that looks, that looks nice actually. All right, the next thing, we want to do is we want to change this alien emoji,

15:10.130 --> 15:11.910
we want to have an actual logo.

15:12.110 --> 15:14.960
So let's grab a free logo that we can find online.

15:15.230 --> 15:23.200
So let's just add, let's find a royalty free icon and I want wanted to have a brain as an icon.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.750
So let's see, if we can find something here.

15:34.530 --> 15:39.820
All right, this is my bigger list to brain, and see if we can find any cool icons.

15:39.870 --> 15:40.570
Oh!, there you go.

15:40.590 --> 15:42.200
This might be a nice one.

15:42.210 --> 15:46.440
Let's do 'png' and will ah! 100 pixels or little,

15:46.470 --> 15:47.210
actually that works.

15:47.220 --> 15:52.000
We can have different files but we'll just do 'png', 100 pixels.

15:52.110 --> 15:53.160
We will download it.

15:57.010 --> 15:58.260
Nice that looks great.

15:58.970 --> 16:05.670
And will just, move it to our project folder, which is on our desktop,

16:09.460 --> 16:15.150
and we can just actually open it up and put it into the folder that we want.

16:15.150 --> 16:23.990
In our case it will be the logo component. So let's just move that in there and we'll call it 'brain.png', perfect.

16:29.080 --> 16:39.190
Then I close that, now that we have a 'brain.png' in there, we can just 'import', 

16:39.200 --> 16:39.720
we can just call it

16:42.270 --> 16:48.630
'brain' from the './brain.png'.

16:48.700 --> 16:53.260
And that would be the default name given to it.

16:53.260 --> 16:58.570
So we can actually just create an image tag in here, we're going to remove that little alien and we'll

16:58.570 --> 17:08.800
just do image(img) and this image will have a source(src), obviously and that source will just be our 'brain'.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.110
So let's see if that works.

17:14.030 --> 17:16.930
Make sure we close the tags here,

17:16.930 --> 17:22.950
save. We're also getting an error saying that we should have an 'alt' tag.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.050
So let's just do that.

17:24.050 --> 17:33.250
'alt' equals 'logo'. Save that.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.090
Look at that!

17:34.110 --> 17:34.660
There you go.

17:34.860 --> 17:39.440
We need our brain a little bit lower, so I'm going to do that quickly with some css.

17:41.190 --> 17:45.130
We're going to do 'padding' of 3(pa3).

17:45.300 --> 17:50.430
And just because I've done this before and I know, we need a bit of padding.

17:50.880 --> 18:01.490
I'll just add a style on the image that says 'paddingTop' of five pixels.

18:02.860 --> 18:05.080
And I make that smaller just so you can see it better.

18:16.050 --> 18:18.100
Let's save, see how that looks.

18:19.130 --> 18:19.400
There you go.

18:19.410 --> 18:23.040
Looking nice, we got ourselves a nice logo.

18:24.340 --> 18:30.360
You can see that we're moving through this fairly quickly, it's nice using react, it's, as long as you figure

18:30.360 --> 18:31.680
out your styles,

18:31.680 --> 18:38.020
it's nice to be able to use all these different components to build out your website. It all goes back to

18:38.050 --> 18:38.430
app

18:38.480 --> 18:39.190
dot js(app.js)

18:39.250 --> 18:40.630
and see what else we have.

18:40.630 --> 18:43.720
We need the 'ImageLinkform'.

18:43.860 --> 18:56.110
So again, let's remove the comments, and bring up the 'ImageLinkForm', will create once again, a new component,

18:59.530 --> 19:00.580
that is the

19:04.010 --> 19:04.600
'ImageLinkForm',

19:29.140 --> 19:31.060
we use our good old copy and paste

19:46.510 --> 19:51.400
and we won't be needing the 'Tilt' or the 'Logo'.

19:51.450 --> 20:02.380
We're going to have an 'ImageLinkForm', 'ImageLinkForm'.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.750
All right, so let's think about what we need in here.

20:04.760 --> 20:13.280
We, definitely want to have a paragraph, that will give it a 'className'.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.310
So it has, size of three,

20:19.410 --> 20:27.150
and within here, we will just say, and I like instead of using text this way because it is javascript

20:27.240 --> 20:37.330
like wrapping it in curly brackets and then doing the quotes and we'll say 'This magic', I can spell, 'Brain

20:37.730 --> 20:51.350
will detect faces in your pictures. Give it a try.'

20:51.350 --> 21:00.030
All right, so we have the paragraph, we also want to have another 'div', where we have an input and a button

21:00.630 --> 21:01.390
perhaps.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.880
So we'll just do 'div',

21:05.630 --> 21:10.330
we'll have an 'input' of 'type', will just be 'text'.

21:10.340 --> 21:13.120
This is where we'll be entering our 'url'

21:16.170 --> 21:17.250
closing that bracket.

21:17.270 --> 21:28.330
And then finally, we'll have a 'button' that will say 'Detect' and again, we can add a few class names to

21:28.330 --> 21:32.020
this just to make it look nicer, using 'tacheons'.

21:32.500 --> 21:40.630
I'll do say, a size of 4(f4), 'padding' of 2(pa2), width is going to be 70 percent,

21:40.930 --> 21:49.220
it's going to be 'centered' and because I said width 70 percent, I can do something along the lines of this,

21:50.180 --> 21:53.080
I can say, width is 30 percent.

21:53.090 --> 22:03.070
So total of 100 percent for that, will grow when you hover over it, 'f4' there will be a link.

22:03.260 --> 22:09.750
And this is, like I said before, if you 'tacheon' commands that you can look up,

22:09.880 --> 22:16.750
it's more for stylistic reasons, so we don't really need to worry too much about it, but most of them

22:16.750 --> 22:19.620
should be pretty self-explanatory.

22:19.630 --> 22:24.620
'Background(bg) light purple'.

22:24.850 --> 22:29.730
Let's save that and see, if that works.

22:29.770 --> 22:31.490
All right awesome.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.420
We want these to actually be in one line together.

22:35.640 --> 22:42.770
A good way to do that is again using the 'div' the parent 'div' that's wrapping them, and we can just give

22:42.770 --> 22:44.030
it a 'className'.

22:44.030 --> 22:52.840
We're going to do 'display', 'flex' and 'justified-content', 'center', we can just create a class on the app.css,

22:52.900 --> 23:03.710
because I feel like we're going to use that a lot. And it will just say 'center' is 'display', 'flex'

23:05.090 --> 23:11.180
and 'justify-content' will be 'center'. You're going to use that a lot,

23:11.180 --> 23:15.570
so, like I said, it's better to just have it there.

23:15.740 --> 23:16.660
And well I think, I,

23:16.670 --> 23:19.560
all right, you put comma in there instead of a semicolon.

23:19.830 --> 23:20.570
There you go.

23:26.250 --> 23:27.950
If I do 'center' here now,

23:28.060 --> 23:29.090
there you go,

23:29.120 --> 23:33.200
that looks much better 70 percent width with 30 percent width,

23:33.200 --> 23:35.650
but we kind of need something to wrap it here.

23:35.650 --> 23:37.170
Make it a little bit smaller.

23:38.630 --> 23:39.910
So I'll add another 'div',

23:43.970 --> 23:58.240
and this 'div' will have 'className' of some 'tacheon' magic, which will be 'pa4', border radius three(br3),

23:58.560 --> 24:06.880
and 'shadow' which is one of my favorite properties, because it gives it a nice shadow.

24:08.560 --> 24:12.040
All right, it looks a little bit off.

24:12.100 --> 24:14.020
We need to fix a couple of things.

24:15.910 --> 24:20.610
And do you know what? I think, for this one we're going to need a few more css properties.

24:20.650 --> 24:24.900
So I'm going to create a new file, in our image link form,

24:28.860 --> 24:40.870
dot css(.css) and within here, we can just create a, a 'form', 'class' and will give it a width of 700 pixels.

24:40.880 --> 24:41.710
If I save that,

24:46.510 --> 24:48.830
and I'll give it the 'center' property here as well.

24:51.370 --> 24:51.750
All right.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.020
That looks better.

24:54.310 --> 24:57.850
Now, for the background again I don't want to be the exact same with this.

24:57.850 --> 25:04.080
Hopefully we can use a nice pattern and I have one my favorite pattern galleries here where you can pick

25:04.080 --> 25:07.500
css patterns.

25:07.610 --> 25:12.260
So the one that I really like is the honeycomb, and we can just copy and paste this

25:15.430 --> 25:18.670
which Paul Salentiny created for us.

25:18.670 --> 25:23.530
Thank you Paul, and just to add it in here.

25:26.940 --> 25:37.820
Let's save that, and go back to our project and we actually should be adding 'form' in here.

25:39.920 --> 25:50.890
Oh! and we don't see any differences because we need to 'import', our file.

25:50.930 --> 25:51.830
All right.

25:51.930 --> 25:53.330
Perfect.

25:53.340 --> 26:01.770
Ah! again we should add 'display', 'flex' to here, so everything is on one line, so we can just use the 'center', class

26:01.770 --> 26:02.190
name.

26:02.990 --> 26:03.910
And there you go.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.190
Look at that.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.330
We have our pattern,

26:06.600 --> 26:16.720
we have our button that grows, and I do want the aah!, the mouse to actually be like this, a pointer and I know that for

26:16.720 --> 26:20.570
any buttons that I create on here that's the default behavior that I want.

26:20.950 --> 26:28.960
So I can actually go all the way to the top of index dot css file, and just say that buttons are going

26:28.960 --> 26:35.490
to have 'cursor' of 'pointer', so that it affects every button on the page.

26:35.690 --> 26:36.350
There you go.

26:36.410 --> 26:42.520
That's much better.

26:42.520 --> 26:42.880
All right.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.670
We're building this pretty fast.

26:44.700 --> 26:45.850
I'm, I'm impressed we're doing,

26:45.850 --> 26:47.520
we're doing a good job.

26:47.830 --> 26:55.000
So we have the input and the last thing is the image.

26:55.150 --> 26:59.430
But I think, we need some functionality before we can actually display the image.

26:59.530 --> 27:05.410
We forgot to do the 'rank' which we want something at the top. So let's do that, let's add a 'rank' component.

27:06.580 --> 27:12.970
And this 'rank' component will give us our user name and our rank compared to all the other users that

27:12.970 --> 27:17.630
have submitted pictures.

27:17.700 --> 27:24.590
We can simply, copy and paste and you can see that there is a lot of repetition here.

27:24.600 --> 27:31.350
But we're building things really really fast because we have a common way of creating these components,

27:31.980 --> 27:33.330
which is really really nice.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.500
Copy the 'ranks',

27:53.300 --> 27:58.910
and by doing 'command control g', you can actually select all the instances of image link form and change

27:58.910 --> 28:00.530
it with logo, again.

28:00.740 --> 28:09.160
Pretty awesome feature of Sublime text, oh! and instead of rank this should say, or instead of logo this should

28:09.160 --> 28:16.700
say 'Rank' and within here, we'll just create a nice little component,

28:19.640 --> 28:22.580
by the way, if you're wondering how I'm adding these styles so fast,

28:22.670 --> 28:27.800
trust me, it took me way too long to figure out what looks good and what doesn't.

28:27.800 --> 28:34.430
I'm just avoiding you the pain of watching me, figure out what cells look best and come back and forth with

28:34.430 --> 28:36.320
the Google Chrome developer tools.

28:36.320 --> 28:43.790
Like I said, styling is just so specific to each app that once you get to your specific app, it'ill, it will be,

28:43.790 --> 28:49.160
very dependent on your specific needs. So, as long as you know the basics, you'll be able to evolve and

28:49.160 --> 28:53.090
change the style of the app, whichever way you want.

28:53.090 --> 28:57.590
So again in here, we'll just have for now,

28:57.590 --> 29:00.460
this is going to be dynamic but for now we just need some text.

29:00.470 --> 29:09.620
I'll just say 'Andrei, Andrei, your current rank is', and below it will do the same thing.

29:10.110 --> 29:12.290
Maybe a little bit bigger this time around.

29:12.570 --> 29:14.260
Or do 'f1',

29:14.310 --> 29:20.080
which is a little bit bigger and I'll say number 5(#5)

29:20.270 --> 29:24.240
for now, save that.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.310
Let me put that back there.

29:27.180 --> 29:30.030
Save and all right.

29:30.050 --> 29:31.150
It's starting to look better.

29:31.280 --> 29:36.080
I think the last thing we want to do before we go into the next video and add some functionality,

29:36.080 --> 29:40.850
is, this fonts pretty generic, so we want to change that a little bit.

29:41.180 --> 29:48.770
So I'm going to change the font in index dot css, because well this is going to affect our entire

29:48.770 --> 29:54.750
app and you can pick your own but I like 'Courier New'.

29:58.410 --> 30:06.710
In case, in case a web browser or the computer that it's on doesn't have that, I'll have some backup.

30:11.420 --> 30:12.500
And yah!, this font,

30:12.500 --> 30:15.230
I am a big fan of, let's check it out.

30:15.230 --> 30:20.710
Look at that, very nice. Build that pretty fast.

30:20.720 --> 30:21.390
Right. You know what?

30:21.410 --> 30:27.050
The very last thing I will do, even though I said this was the last thing is one of my favorite things

30:27.140 --> 30:28.860
is this particles

30:28.890 --> 30:30.360
dot js(particle.js) library.

30:30.500 --> 30:35.660
You actually see it in a lot of Web sites being used. Particles dot js,

30:35.750 --> 30:38.390
yeah! it lets you do these sort of things.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.740
So you can have a background that's interactive.

30:43.900 --> 30:49.230
And you can change how many particles you have, and do all these cool things.

30:51.690 --> 30:54.570
And I think it makes your webapps look really really nice.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.760
So we're going to use this.

30:55.800 --> 31:06.010
They actually have a react version that we can use, so we can just say, 'particles react npm',

31:06.290 --> 31:12.720
and there's a few you can pick from, but this is the one I used before so we'll stick to this one.

31:14.810 --> 31:18.380
And again, we can just copy and paste the 'npm install'

31:21.660 --> 31:28.770
and just so, I don't have to keep stopping and starting this, if you do 'command d' with terminal you get

31:28.770 --> 31:30.170
a new window.

31:30.180 --> 31:36.590
But if you want it to be below, if you do 'command' + 'shift' + 'd', you will get a window right below it.

31:37.000 --> 31:46.090
So in here, I can just do 'npm install'

31:46.280 --> 31:54.500
So now that, that's downloaded, if we go down to here, we can see exactly how we can use it.

31:54.760 --> 32:04.080
So we can just copy and paste, these particles component, will add it because it's the back of right below the

32:04.080 --> 32:07.160
main 'div' element.

32:07.230 --> 32:09.630
And as you can see there's a couple of options here.

32:10.020 --> 32:15.180
And there's a few things that you don't really need in here, so I'm going to remove those and for the

32:15.180 --> 32:22.210
parameters, I don't like having our render method be so ugly, so I like taking out the parameters,

32:25.320 --> 32:37.530
and creating a 'constant' called, let's call that, 'particlesOptions' and outside of here we can just create

32:37.530 --> 32:40.700
that variable, just to keep things clean.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.480
And have this object configurable.

32:48.050 --> 32:50.770
So if we save this, let's see how that looks.

32:51.170 --> 32:56.210
Oops! I'll get an error because I haven't imported the 'particles' library yet.

32:56.690 --> 33:02.450
So again going back here, I can just copy and paste the 'import' syntax.

33:02.540 --> 33:03.520
Save it,

33:04.890 --> 33:05.990
and close this for now.

33:06.100 --> 33:08.910
Let's go back to our app.

33:09.020 --> 33:15.760
You see over here that it's over written on top of everything, and everything else is below it.

33:18.360 --> 33:26.550
This needs a bit of configuration, and it's a little bit tricky but we can add something, like a new

33:26.550 --> 33:39.460
'className' and we'll call it 'particles', and we'll create this 'particles' class and our css, you know what?

33:39.460 --> 33:40.770
all this over here we don't use,

33:40.780 --> 33:46.060
so I'm going to delete just to keep things clean, and we'll save 'particles'.

33:46.750 --> 33:50.200
And this is a new css syntax that you might not have seen.

33:50.260 --> 33:51.950
It's called 'fixed'.

33:52.210 --> 33:53.560
So everything stays,

33:53.590 --> 34:01.990
even if you scroll of things stays, exactly where it is. And you can actually get these properties on

34:01.990 --> 34:04.470
the 'particles' website.

34:04.480 --> 34:12.510
So if you want to read more on it, you can check it out but it makes sure that everything is full screen.

34:12.580 --> 34:22.780
The background's fixed and finally, to make sure that everything is underneath our, the rest of our app,

34:23.140 --> 34:28.650
we do something called 'z-index' and 'z-index', you're allowed to use when you use position 'fixed' or position

34:28.690 --> 34:34.240
'absolute'. And it tells you, what layer you want the image to be on.

34:34.270 --> 34:41.110
In our case we're adding 'minus 1' because we're saying that this should be below pretty much anything

34:41.110 --> 34:42.680
else on our website.

34:42.700 --> 34:45.260
If we go back.

34:45.300 --> 34:45.680
All right.

34:45.690 --> 34:51.440
And aah!, you can see here that the patterns are a little bit weird and I've played around with it already

34:51.450 --> 34:56.070
to figure out what 'particle' options I enjoy.

34:56.280 --> 34:59.480
And you can customize this and play around with it yourself.

35:00.730 --> 35:04.970
The main thing I want to do is have the number of particles,

35:05.920 --> 35:07.210
to definitely have a lot more.

35:07.220 --> 35:11.240
So I'm gonna say, 'value: 30' and 'density'

35:13.990 --> 35:16.680
will have a few options.

35:26.380 --> 35:32.450
That should make our app look a lot nicer, look at that. Again all these options,

35:32.450 --> 35:35.350
you can read up on them on 'particles

35:35.370 --> 35:35.790
dot js(particle.js),

35:35.810 --> 35:42.200
and the 'npm package' itself, you can make it interactive as this if you want, but there's definitely a

35:42.200 --> 35:43.430
lot of options for you.

35:45.740 --> 35:46.100
All right.

35:46.190 --> 35:47.720
This is pretty incredible, right?

35:47.720 --> 35:55.440
We did that pretty fast and the cool thing is that, everything is responsive.

35:55.540 --> 35:56.130
Look at that.

35:57.390 --> 36:03.460
So, as I move this, we can display this app on our phone, as well.

36:03.750 --> 36:07.360
And all these mobile devices, very cool.

36:07.360 --> 36:11.660
So we took care of the view and the basic components for now.
