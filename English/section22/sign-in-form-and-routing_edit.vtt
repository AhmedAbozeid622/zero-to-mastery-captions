00:01.490 --> 00:02.290
Welcome back.

00:02.290 --> 00:07.840
It's time to create a 'sign in' form. Maybe even a 'Registration' form because for new users, you wanna

00:07.850 --> 00:09.020
register them.

00:10.850 --> 00:11.870
So let's work on that.

00:14.010 --> 00:21.550
We first, want to perhaps create a 'sign in' and a 'registration' component. So let's do that.

00:21.570 --> 00:32.120
I'm going to create a new folder, call it 'SignIn' and this folder will have a new file called 'signIn'

00:32.390 --> 00:32.970
dot

00:33.190 --> 00:33.780
'js'.

00:37.270 --> 00:45.900
And again using our best friend, copy and paste, we can use that and call this 'Signin'.

00:46.210 --> 00:52.390
And we don't have any css for it. And no props yet. Within here

00:52.390 --> 01:02.050
we definitely want to have a 'Signin' form. And luckily for us because we're using 'tachyons', well, if we

01:02.830 --> 01:14.370
search 'tachyons' form, they should have, oh! looks like they have a sign in form just for us so we can use.

01:14.430 --> 01:15.370
All right this looks awesome.

01:15.420 --> 01:19.400
We can just copy and paste this code,

01:19.740 --> 01:24.650
and again because we have 'tachyons' the classes will be automatically applied.

01:24.700 --> 01:27.460
So let's do that. Fix indentation a bit.

01:32.290 --> 01:36.230
Let's save. And you see here that the syntax is wrong.

01:36.640 --> 01:41.780
Well that's because with JSX, we could have gotten away in, when we

01:41.780 --> 01:45.090
let me make this smaller. In html,

01:45.260 --> 01:52.580
we didn't necessarily have to close the input boxes. But here with JSX, we have to make sure that the

01:52.580 --> 01:57.530
input tags are closed off.

01:57.560 --> 02:05.030
So now our case, we have three inputs, I believe. So we can save that and there's still something off. Let's see,

02:05.030 --> 02:06.480
what else we had.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.510
And we have one more 'input' in here.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.210
All right.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.030
You see the highlighting is fixed.

02:12.140 --> 02:15.440
Let's just make sure this works by adding this 'signin' component to our app

02:15.440 --> 02:16.320
dot js.

02:25.950 --> 02:32.180
And then finally, we can just put it at the top for now, to make sure that it works.

02:34.930 --> 02:36.180
Let's see what happens.

02:36.580 --> 02:41.400
It's compiled successfully, going back and all right, we got the form.

02:41.650 --> 02:47.170
It doesn't look too bad, but there are definitely a few things off. We don't want this bottom stuff and

02:47.170 --> 02:51.110
we need everything centered.

02:51.140 --> 02:54.830
Well, one thing, I want, I want this to kind of have a card underneath it.

02:54.900 --> 02:59.220
So if I go back to 'tachyons' and I do 'tachyons' cards,

03:02.920 --> 03:05.170
it's like a product card.

03:05.170 --> 03:05.590
All right.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.250
I like the look of this product card but I just like the boundaries of it.

03:09.290 --> 03:16.620
I don't need to copy the contents. So I'm going to just copy this 'article' tag, and add it

03:20.050 --> 03:20.780
in here.

03:23.980 --> 03:25.540
Close off the 'article' tag,

03:29.420 --> 03:30.600
and let's see how that looks.

03:34.410 --> 03:38.960
All right, we got the boundary box at least, but everything's kind of pushed off.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.760
Again we're going to start removing some things that we don't need.

03:41.990 --> 03:44.850
We don't need the 'forgot your password',

03:45.330 --> 03:47.130
we don't need the 'Remember Me'.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.850
Let's save, go back to that.

03:54.090 --> 04:01.560
And again we want to make sure that this is centered, and we actually want to change the classes here,

04:02.480 --> 04:03.010
to,

04:03.010 --> 04:05.280
again I did command control,

04:08.060 --> 04:14.700
command control 'g' to have all these multiple cursors and I'll just say 'className' and we actually want

04:14.700 --> 04:20.260
to remove this 'center' over here, we already have it up here.

04:20.340 --> 04:23.090
All right things are starting to look a little bit better.

04:23.100 --> 04:30.400
I want to make a bit of a shadow around the border, so again maybe change the 'border radius' to three

04:30.900 --> 04:41.160
and change some of these values, I'm gonna add my favorite shadow, and I don't think I need this.

04:41.290 --> 04:42.520
Let's see how that looks.

04:43.610 --> 04:47.610
All right that's better look at that border that's looking very nice.

04:49.950 --> 04:56.620
And maybe we want this a little bit bigger and this should say 'register' instead of 'sign up' because

04:56.640 --> 05:00.540
well, we want to ideally have another form for a registry.

05:00.750 --> 05:12.030
So we'll say 'Register' here, and then for a 'sign In' we'll say, 'f1', save that, go back.

05:12.060 --> 05:13.300
All right.

05:13.410 --> 05:15.000
That doesn't look too bad, actually.

05:17.930 --> 05:21.150
And if I type things here, everything looks good.

05:23.130 --> 05:23.460
Perfect.

05:23.460 --> 05:27.470
So we have the 'sign in' form. This 'Sign In' form,

05:27.620 --> 05:32.810
well, we don't want it to show this, when this app is active.

05:32.810 --> 05:40.860
Ideally we have a 'Sign In' form and once a user signs in, then they're able to access the homepage.

05:40.970 --> 05:42.220
So let's do that.

05:42.230 --> 05:45.770
It sounds like we need a bit of state.

05:46.020 --> 05:55.320
If I go to app dot js, and this is a problem that is very common in maps and there are libraries that you can

05:55.320 --> 05:57.910
use, but for us, I want to build this from scratch.

05:57.920 --> 06:06.810
So we have a better understanding of how things work. We can create a route state, and the route keeps

06:06.810 --> 06:09.410
track of where we are on the page.

06:09.450 --> 06:14.120
In our case, we want it to start on 'signin'.

06:14.130 --> 06:21.250
So when the app, initially loads and the constructor gets run, 'signin' or 'route' should be 'signin'.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.130
So now that we have this 'signin',

06:24.130 --> 06:27.240
well it sounds like a conditional statement right.

06:27.250 --> 06:34.460
We can just say that, if, and I can do an if statement here because we're inside of a return statement.

06:35.010 --> 06:41.110
But because these are just, this is just JSX, we can wrap things in curly brackets.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.570
And now it's a javascript expression.

06:43.780 --> 06:47.120
So we'll say, we'll wrap this in curly brackets,

06:47.200 --> 06:49.640
And we want the navigation there no matter what.

06:49.720 --> 06:55.330
If 'this' dot 'state' dot 'route' equals

06:58.380 --> 07:00.300
'signin'.
 
07:00.630 --> 07:09.610
If that's true, then I want you to return the 'signin' component. Otherwise you can return,

07:12.400 --> 07:13.940
the 'Logo' component.

07:14.150 --> 07:18.210
Let's just change the spacing here, just so it looks a little bit better. Let's save,

07:22.010 --> 07:23.670
and see if that works.

07:23.690 --> 07:30.440
There you go, added that. We see that, we get an error here saying, well, json ajax elements must be wrapped in

07:30.440 --> 07:34.800
an enclosing tag. Remember because we're returning multiple elements here,

07:34.910 --> 07:35.590
that doesn't work.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.760
We need to wrap them.

07:37.130 --> 07:39.610
Yeah that error message is a little bit tricky.

07:42.130 --> 07:47.890
But, you get used to it after a while, so we want to wrap this, in a

07:52.330 --> 07:58.360
'div'. Let's save. Let's go back.

07:58.380 --> 07:58.790
All right.

07:58.810 --> 08:00.680
Let's look at the console,

08:00.820 --> 08:05.380
no errors but still showing 'signin'. So let's check to make sure that we did this right.

08:05.950 --> 08:11.140
If 'this' dot 'state' dot 'route' equals 'signin'.

08:11.310 --> 08:13.580
And as you can see, I spelled that wrong.

08:15.050 --> 08:16.300
And that's why (it) wasn't working.

08:16.490 --> 08:18.840
If I save.

08:19.060 --> 08:19.940
There you go.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.870
We get our 'Sign In'.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.140
And if I change this to something else,

08:25.440 --> 08:28.680
well in that case, we get our homescreen.

08:28.920 --> 08:29.700
Amazing.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.740
Just simple conditionals in javascript, and we have our self-direct (?).

08:33.950 --> 08:37.330
Let's expand on this. Let's do sign in.

08:37.530 --> 08:40.440
And now, if the user signs in,

08:43.350 --> 08:51.110
while we want to direct them to the homepage. So let's create a function on 'signin' and this prop will

08:51.120 --> 08:55.500
have, we'll call it 'onRouteChange'.

08:55.500 --> 09:02.390
So when route changes, it's going to be 'this' dot 'onRouteChange'.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.180
And let's write that function.

09:05.430 --> 09:11.320
We can say, 'onRouteChange' using arrow functions.

09:11.460 --> 09:19.210
Let's think about this, for now we can just save 'this' dot 'setState' to 'home'. Doesn't mean much but

09:19.390 --> 09:23.550
it changes, the 'signin' route to 'home'.

09:25.780 --> 09:29.970
So let's get that working. I'm going to save.

09:30.160 --> 09:34.310
Oh! got to wrap this in curly brackets because it's an object.

09:34.320 --> 09:34.630
Yeah.

09:34.840 --> 09:44.680
And now if we go into the 'signin' component, we can say, for this 'input', we can just have an 'onClick' event handler.

09:44.680 --> 09:50.640
So let me, add this on a new space, just so you can see a better.

09:58.060 --> 10:08.510
Make this bigger a bit, there you go, will do an 'onClick' and 'onClick' this 'signin' will receive the 'onRouteChange'

10:09.880 --> 10:20.320
event handler, and we'll just say 'onRouteChange', will save. Let's go back, going to click 'Sign In' and it's working.

10:23.180 --> 10:25.320
All right, we also want to click 'onSignOut'

10:25.340 --> 10:28.420
and it should take us to the 'Sign In' page.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.190
So again we have the 'onRouteChange',

10:33.060 --> 10:44.020
but this time on the click of the sign out which is the 'Navigation' over here, we want it to go to route.

10:44.030 --> 10:45.240
So how can we do that?

10:45.330 --> 10:53.520
We'll let's go to the 'Navigation' component and we want to say on the 'p' tag that there's going to be an 'onClick'

10:54.720 --> 11:02.610
and the 'onclick' event, which we haven't written yet, but we do have the 'onRouteChange'.

11:02.660 --> 11:11.290
So based on that, I can pass that in as a prop and going back to the app dot js,

11:11.340 --> 11:21.910
we can pass in to 'Navigation' 'onRouteChange', 'this' dot 'onRouteChange'.

11:22.160 --> 11:33.240
But, there's an issue here, because once I 'Sign In' and I click 'Sign Out' while nothing happenes. We're never

11:33.390 --> 11:35.600
changing the route to 'signin'.

11:35.640 --> 11:45.750
Ideally when we click, we change the route to 'Sign In', so that this statement over here evaluates to

11:45.750 --> 11:50.310
true and we get the sign in form.

11:50.320 --> 11:57.880
So it sounds like instead of us just statically entering home to 'onRouteChange', we need to dynamically

11:58.210 --> 11:59.800
say that our route

12:02.750 --> 12:05.320
is going to be where we give it.

12:05.330 --> 12:07.460
We need to change 'onRouteChange' and 'signin',

12:07.490 --> 12:12.130
and 'onRouteChange' and 'Navigation'.

12:12.340 --> 12:16.180
So let's go to 'Signin' first and say that 'onRouteChange' 'home'.

12:18.930 --> 12:24.240
Now, we don't want to actually run this function. The way we have it now is that, we're going to run this

12:24.240 --> 12:27.850
function when it gets rendered.

12:27.860 --> 12:33.170
But that's not what you want, we want it to run whenever 'onClick' happens and then 'onClick' will call

12:33.170 --> 12:34.410
this function.

12:34.410 --> 12:42.340
So the way we do that is, we can do an arrow function. And this arrow function will just have an 'onRoute

12:43.030 --> 12:43.980
Change' 'home'.

12:44.180 --> 12:50.870
So it's just a function that's going to get called. Here we're just defining the function.

12:51.010 --> 12:54.020
Let's do the same thing in 'Navigation' as well.

12:54.070 --> 13:03.440
In 'Navigation' 'onRouteChange', will now pass a parameter, but instead of 'home', it will say 'signin'. Let's see

13:03.440 --> 13:04.400
if that works.

13:05.650 --> 13:14.800
Going to 'Sign In' and 'Sign Out'. 'Sign In' and 'Sign Out', awesome.

13:14.860 --> 13:18.940
We're not going to worry too much about getting an error because we haven't entered anything.

13:18.940 --> 13:21.200
For now we want to make sure that the routes work.

13:21.480 --> 13:21.690
All right.

13:21.690 --> 13:24.480
Let's also build out the register for a new user.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.700
We want them to have a register.

13:26.710 --> 13:32.730
Maybe it's also asked for the name, of the user.

13:32.900 --> 13:38.650
And just to keep things simple, we will just add a new folder in 'components'.

13:38.870 --> 13:46.740
And this is going to be, 'register' and this is going to be very similar to 'sign in'.

13:46.760 --> 13:54.680
So we'll, we'll have a bit of a code duplication. But again we're just building it fairly fast so it should

13:54.680 --> 13:55.630
be fine for now.

13:59.160 --> 14:04.730
So copying this from 'Signin', we can just copy everything from 'Signin' and go to 'Register'.

14:04.890 --> 14:13.790
And now change the 'Signin' to 'Register' and the 'Register' maybe we'll add a number field.

14:13.960 --> 14:29.620
Maybe that field will have at the top just the name. And we'll say 'for' 'name', 'type' 'text' and 'name' will be

14:29.680 --> 14:38.050
just 'name'. 'id' we'll just say 'name'. We actually don't need these properties they just came with the form

14:38.050 --> 14:40.570
that I copy and pasted from 'tachyons'.

14:40.900 --> 14:44.280
But, it does the job for now, it should be good.

14:44.450 --> 14:47.510
And we don't need the 'Register' link at the bottom.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.020
Let's save.

14:52.430 --> 14:57.810
And if we go back to the 'Signin', we also don't really want this to be an anchor tag.

14:57.860 --> 15:04.300
We want to do a route change, so we can just maybe do a 'p' tag

15:08.330 --> 15:14.390
and this 'p' tag will have the 'onClick' event as well.

15:14.590 --> 15:20.280
And on click, it will say that from 'signin'  we want to go to 'register'.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.380
Perfect.

15:21.400 --> 15:27.550
And then finally, if you go to app dot js, we wanna import this component,

15:32.790 --> 15:35.710
'Register' and 'Register'.

15:39.570 --> 15:46.420
And 'Register' is defined but never used, because we need to add it to our render.

15:46.430 --> 15:54.760
Now this is a little bit tricky because we kind of have to do a few more conditional checks. Will move

15:54.940 --> 15:57.790
this a little bit around just to have cleaner code.

15:57.790 --> 16:08.320
I'm going to say, if 'state' dot 'route' is 'home', in that case, I want you to render our homescreen

16:12.140 --> 16:14.300
and otherwise,

16:19.270 --> 16:22.780
I'm gonna have another expression, so I'm wrapping it in curly brackets.

16:23.400 --> 16:31.700
And this other expression, we'll have another ternary, that will say 'this' dot 'state' dot 'route' equals

16:33.540 --> 16:41.320
'signin', if it's signed in then we'll return the 'Signin' form,

16:44.500 --> 16:51.930
otherwise, we will return the 'Register' form.

16:52.090 --> 16:53.920
And I know there's better ways to do it.

16:53.920 --> 16:58.250
We could have just pulled this out over here or done it and the return statement.

16:58.480 --> 17:02.910
But for now, we want this to get working so we can test that out.

17:02.950 --> 17:03.680
We have 'Sign In'.

17:03.700 --> 17:10.490
If I click 'Register', I go to register but we need to change the title so we can actually see that that.

17:10.540 --> 17:11.740
Let's do that one more time.

17:11.920 --> 17:20.630
Let's go back to 'Register' and we'll change the title to 'Register'.

17:20.650 --> 17:22.150
Let's go back, we are on 'Sign in'.

17:22.150 --> 17:33.440
If I click 'Register', I go to 'Register' and if I click 'Sign in', I'm finally in. And let's finally also change

17:33.440 --> 17:38.890
the input 'type' 'submit' or the 'value' to 'Register'.

17:39.170 --> 17:40.360
Let's save that again.

17:43.370 --> 17:47.030
Go back, 'Register', clicks on 'Register'.

17:47.510 --> 17:52.460
I don't know if you also noticed that we're not getting the cursor when we click on 'Register', so let's

17:52.460 --> 17:53.370
fix that.

17:53.480 --> 17:58.830
We'll go to 'signin' and we'll say that on this 'p' tag,

17:58.840 --> 18:02.270
we will say, that it's a 'pointer'

18:02.750 --> 18:08.710
class.

18:08.920 --> 18:09.310
There you go. Whoo! All right.

18:09.370 --> 18:13.110
So we're getting our form, which is good.

18:13.130 --> 18:17.250
The last thing that I want to fix is the 'Sign Out'.

18:17.410 --> 18:26.980
I want to be able to have 'Sign Out' only when I'm at home, and maybe when I'm on the 'Sign In' or 'Register',

18:27.100 --> 18:32.290
I have the two navigation tabs over here.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.010
That's fairly easy to do.

18:34.020 --> 18:40.110
We can go back to 'Navigation' and in 'Navigation', we can say that,

18:45.410 --> 18:50.790
if 'isSignedIn', a variable, that we don't have yet, but we can create one.

18:51.020 --> 18:59.770
I just want you to think about how we want to design this. So, if it's signed in, the user, in that case

18:59.980 --> 19:01.030
we want to display

19:03.780 --> 19:07.750
this, right?

19:07.880 --> 19:14.120
Otherwise, we can display, and I'm showing you how to do this without the ternary, the way that we did

19:14.120 --> 19:14.940
it in the app

19:14.950 --> 19:15.680
dot js.

19:15.770 --> 19:17.260
I just want to show you both ways.

19:17.420 --> 19:26.330
If the user isn't signed in then perhaps we should have two navigations, one that says

19:29.440 --> 19:34.940
'Sign In' and another one that says 'Register'.

19:39.150 --> 19:42.630
And over here, I see that we're turning this entire thing

19:42.660 --> 19:49.740
instead of what I should have been doing, is returning the individual.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.400
So, here I'll say 'return',

19:57.180 --> 20:00.490
wrap this in a bracket.

20:00.750 --> 20:12.680
And we have the first return and then if it's signed in, then we'll do 'return'.

20:12.810 --> 20:16.190
Let's save that, Oop! I made another mistake here.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.930
We don't need that to 'nav' things.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.780
We actually just want the middle 'p' tag

20:24.920 --> 20:30.230
and here, just add the two links.

20:30.380 --> 20:35.870
So the 'Sign In' and 'Register'. So we can remove this, because it was giving me and error because I was returning

20:35.870 --> 20:36.840
more than one thing.

20:39.020 --> 20:39.820
All right.

20:39.900 --> 20:40.690
Looks good.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.210
We want to make sure that the 'onRouteChange',

20:43.230 --> 20:52.570
if we click on 'Sign In', they all go to 'home', if we click on 'Register' again, it will also go to 'home'.

20:52.890 --> 20:57.360
If I click 'Sign Out', I'll go to 'Sign In'.

20:57.510 --> 21:00.790
And then finally 'isSignedIn' doesn't exist yet,

21:01.170 --> 21:12.360
so it looks like we need to add a new state, and we'll call this one 'isSignedIn' and

21:12.690 --> 21:17.390
to start off, it's going to be false. And there's something that we can easily do

21:17.400 --> 21:26.920
in the 'onRouteChange'. 'onRouteChange' we can perhaps add another if statement, and we'll say if 'route'

21:29.300 --> 21:33.450
equals 'signout'.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.540
So for trying to sign out.

21:35.930 --> 21:45.540
well then we should 'setState' of 'isSignedIn' to false because we're signing out.

21:45.710 --> 21:46.760
Else if

21:49.280 --> 22:04.680
'route' equals 'home', well in that case, we wanna 'setState' of 'isSignedIn' to true.

22:05.310 --> 22:11.520
And you might be thinking, do we wanna not authenticate and make sure that they have access to getting

22:11.520 --> 22:15.750
home? and that's something that we are not going to worry about for now, we just want to get it working.

22:16.050 --> 22:21.330
So if the 'route' is 'signout' then 'isSignedIn' will be false.

22:21.330 --> 22:23.920
If the 'route' is 'home' then well they're obviously signed it.

22:24.030 --> 22:25.620
So it's going to be true.

22:25.830 --> 22:31.790
And no matter what, we still want to change the 'route'. Let's see if this actually works.

22:31.950 --> 22:41.950
I go back, I click on 'Register', oop! I'm going to 'home' instead of going to 'Register' page.

22:41.970 --> 22:45.510
So I made a mistake here, if I go into 'Navigation',

22:45.510 --> 22:51.750
obviously if I click on register, we want to go to the 'register' and if I click on 'Sign In', we want to

22:51.750 --> 22:58.300
go to 'signin'. Llet's save that, let's try that again.

22:59.410 --> 23:01.840
'Sign In', nothing happens because we're already here.

23:01.930 --> 23:02.500
Sign, 'Register',

23:02.500 --> 23:04.030
nice,

23:04.040 --> 23:06.470
'Sign In', 'Register', 'Sign In', 'Register'

23:06.490 --> 23:08.900
Perfect. Try click on 'Register' here,

23:09.040 --> 23:19.000
I go to 'Register', if I click 'Register', I'm at 'home', and oop! we see tha, we need this change to 'Sign Out' and

23:19.000 --> 23:21.700
that is on the 'home' page, so we can go back to app dot

23:21.770 --> 23:23.040
js

23:23.080 --> 23:24.620
And it's a simple fix.

23:24.730 --> 23:25.930
We can go back here.

23:26.020 --> 23:34.390
We want to actually pass the prop here of 'isSignedIn' to be 'this' dot 'state'

23:34.410 --> 23:44.280
dot 'signin'. Oop! that's not it, 'isSignedIn'. Let's save. So if we go back here, we see that uh! it's not

23:44.280 --> 23:44.760
working.

23:44.760 --> 23:52.970
And that's because again this is why it's so tricky with javascript, I made 'false' into a string.

23:53.130 --> 24:03.310
So when it checks, 'isSignedIn' over here false, technically is true in javascript because it's a string,

24:03.310 --> 24:04.390
so it exists.

24:04.420 --> 24:08.770
If I go to here, and I do 'Boolean'

24:11.350 --> 24:15.190
false, will say that it's true.

24:18.180 --> 24:19.580
So let's go back to that.

24:19.590 --> 24:25.740
I'm going to say, isSignedIn', this should be false, a boolean.

24:25.740 --> 24:28.660
So now let's see if that works.

24:29.400 --> 24:34.670
It's going to register. If I click 'Register', it's home if I click 'Sign out', I am signing out.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.530
But see how this isn't changed.

24:38.310 --> 24:42.380
Because I made another mistake here.

24:42.540 --> 24:49.950
When we click 'sign out' over here, we ideally want to go and say 'signout'

24:53.310 --> 24:54.390
and when we sign out,

25:00.640 --> 25:04.870
we sign out properly.

25:04.880 --> 25:12.750
All right. We got ourselves a nice working app.

25:12.790 --> 25:20.050
There's a few cleanup materials that we can do here, such as removing the 'console'.

25:20.140 --> 25:24.650
We're also using 'this' dot 'state' a lot, where we can use destructuring.

25:24.970 --> 25:41.560
So I can just have 'isSignedIn', 'imageUrl', 'route' and 'box' destructured.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.140
So now I can make things a little bit cleaner.

25:48.660 --> 25:50.570
By removing 'this' dot 'state' everywhere,

25:58.920 --> 25:59.700
there you go.

26:03.180 --> 26:05.520
Oh! and I have to add 'const' here.

26:08.610 --> 26:09.330
All right.

26:09.490 --> 26:12.200
Perfect, this looks pretty good.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.530
'OnButtonSubmit', 'onInputChange',

26:16.570 --> 26:17.770
Everything is looking nice.

26:17.770 --> 26:20.440
We have our 'calculateFaceLocation'.

26:20.500 --> 26:26.380
There's obviously a few things that we can improve upon, but for now we have a working app that does

26:26.440 --> 26:28.090
exactly what we need to.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.710
It does face recognition and it works nicely.

26:31.720 --> 26:37.060
I also want to see the console, make sure that we don't get any errors. And we see that we have two things

26:37.060 --> 26:37.640
here.

26:38.050 --> 26:40.140
One is invalid DOM property for.

26:40.180 --> 26:47.930
Did you mean htmlFor?, it gives us a nice error that says at Signin dot js, and that is because again

26:47.930 --> 26:52.880
we're using JSX and 'for' is a javascript word.

26:53.000 --> 27:01.760
So even though in html you can use 'for' for 'labels' to attach them to input, in JSX we have to do a 'htmlFor', so

27:01.760 --> 27:09.630
we can do 'htmlFor', 'htmlFor',

27:13.610 --> 27:17.410
save that, and we'll have to do that and the 'Register' as well.

27:26.570 --> 27:28.080
And that works.

27:28.190 --> 27:34.250
But when I click 'Sign In', I get, the form submission canceled because the form is not connected, and that

27:34.250 --> 27:36.130
is because with HTML,

27:36.350 --> 27:42.650
remember when we worked on forms, it automatically if there is an input or a button when there is an

27:42.740 --> 27:50.180
'onSubmit' event, where there's 'type' submit, you will automatically try and send those forms.

27:50.180 --> 27:53.690
If I actually change this to a 'div',

27:58.080 --> 28:06.030
and I save that, if we go back to 'Register' and I click 'Register', I don't get that error anymore. Again,

28:06.060 --> 28:13.080
because in future videos when we create the backend, we won't be necessarily sending a form,

28:13.080 --> 28:15.690
we're going to be sending it through JSON, which is more dynamic.

28:15.690 --> 28:18.310
We can customize things a little bit better.

28:18.510 --> 28:25.530
We can just not worry about html forms, so that we have full customization with JSON. So we can do the

28:25.530 --> 28:27.510
same here as well.

28:33.620 --> 28:36.000
And again, signing again, no errors.

28:36.020 --> 28:38.090
Everything works as intended.

28:38.090 --> 28:46.900
If the form part was confusing make sure you check out the HTTP, JSON and AJAX section. Like I said before,

28:46.910 --> 28:52.120
forms automatically submit or tried to submit things for us, we're not submitting anything yet.

28:52.130 --> 28:58.310
We're going to create our own server, where we're going to be able to sign in our own users and register

28:58.430 --> 29:01.370
our own new users.

29:01.380 --> 29:06.330
There's a few things that we can clean up and we don't need to worry about, because we have a working

29:06.520 --> 29:13.470
app. And now I want to start diving into creating a server, so that we can actually sign in people and

29:13.470 --> 29:18.840
sign out and have a server that this website interacts with.

29:18.940 --> 29:20.550
I'll see you in that one by. Buh-bye
