00:00.080 --> 00:06.620
And well come back it's time to install postgresql as curial on our windows machines.

00:06.660 --> 00:12.570
This as always we'll look for you if you can download the app by typing Post course download into the

00:12.570 --> 00:13.690
Google search.

00:13.780 --> 00:20.520
But for the first result we get a visual postscript postscripts downloads page there we pick the windows

00:21.390 --> 00:32.610
and when they install there we get redirected to another page to E-D post and the price dippie And now

00:32.610 --> 00:37.950
we have to watch what you have to pick that version for your right Windows system.

00:38.340 --> 00:44.310
As you know there are windows 64 bit and Windows 32 bit versions.

00:44.310 --> 00:46.820
Just be sure that you pick the right one.

00:46.860 --> 00:49.870
In my case it's the 64 bit version.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.030
And I can download.

00:53.190 --> 00:55.240
This is a really huge file.

00:55.660 --> 01:02.590
And for this I've already downloaded it and I can live here and close it.

01:03.690 --> 01:08.440
Let's move into my downloads directory and there I have the postscript as queue up.

01:08.570 --> 01:15.770
And so this is Lomo install and it starts last Melcombe page.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.740
Click next the install directory.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.980
Keep this path in mind.

01:23.490 --> 01:27.240
We will need this path aftermarket next.

01:27.690 --> 01:34.290
Yes we will install everything with chips with post-Christmas CULE install starts at the rectory.

01:34.290 --> 01:42.330
You can leave it and now you have to define your password for the user postscripts.

01:42.600 --> 01:47.490
In this case I will use test because a chart.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.190
Next the default port.

01:50.190 --> 01:58.030
Just leave it 5 4 3 2 is the default port default local information.

01:58.080 --> 02:06.500
Just leave all to this one until you get a nice summary about what you can figure out and what you choose.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.100
Just hit next.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.500
And now it takes a long time.

02:12.540 --> 02:15.030
Let me fastforward is that you don't have to wait

02:18.640 --> 02:19.450
who.

02:19.510 --> 02:21.700
That was a really long install.

02:22.240 --> 02:26.330
No let us um check this one and hit finish.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.130
Let me close this.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.950
And now let's have a look.

02:31.950 --> 02:40.630
If it already work ethics back to the command prompt by typing the command which you already know from

02:40.630 --> 02:41.970
Andreas wheedles.

02:42.310 --> 02:51.130
P.S. to hit enter is not recognized as internal or external command.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.780
Why not.

02:52.810 --> 02:55.440
We already installed it.

02:55.480 --> 03:01.570
Let me close the command prompt to check if it is probably installed.

03:01.930 --> 03:06.500
You can use that too which already shipped with the installer.

03:06.910 --> 03:16.630
It's the PGE admin for this movement into the boss Chris S Q will help and choose Peachi up in full.

03:17.560 --> 03:24.660
This is the program with the graphical user interface Andri uses on his make peace Q.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.620
But this one is not the way it will on Windows.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.880
You can use Peachi admin.

03:31.150 --> 03:34.110
This is the interface of this tool.

03:34.150 --> 03:38.230
Click on this plus sign and an account is a plus.

03:38.230 --> 03:47.410
On and on the base gross and yet looks like it worked.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.300
We have installed postscripts as queue.

03:50.830 --> 03:51.820
Let me close this

03:55.150 --> 04:09.380
have a look into this directory again here you see a lot of those things and also ask L shell P S Q

04:10.330 --> 04:12.560
Let us start this one.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.030
So a local host is ok.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.180
Just hit enter at the base post Chris.

04:18.190 --> 04:24.260
Yes just use this one the port use default port and the username.

04:24.270 --> 04:29.700
What this username default super user is post Chris.

04:29.740 --> 04:36.380
So just hit enter here again and the password which you find in my case it was text.

04:37.030 --> 04:41.960
And don't worry that you don't see anything if you enter the password.

04:42.100 --> 04:49.810
This is a normal security layer on the command prompt on such command line tools that don't display

04:49.810 --> 04:51.560
the amount of characters.

04:51.850 --> 04:56.270
So just type it in and press enter.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.040
All right.

04:57.040 --> 05:06.650
We are in postscripts mode also but I'm a guy who wants everything within one command prompt and they

05:06.650 --> 05:07.960
will start the command prompt.

05:07.960 --> 05:11.040
I want to you want to use it also there.

05:11.650 --> 05:13.190
So let me quit it.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.120
But think control.

05:15.160 --> 05:19.640
See I'm typing this again.

05:19.710 --> 05:24.080
Move into the command prompt and try it again.

05:25.210 --> 05:27.400
It doesn't work there.

05:27.420 --> 05:30.400
This is something I will show you to fix.

05:30.470 --> 05:37.810
And the next lecture becomes therefore we have to edit the system environmental pathway rule.

05:38.050 --> 05:46.010
You may remember it from the get lecture or the no just lecture so I'll see you in the next one.
