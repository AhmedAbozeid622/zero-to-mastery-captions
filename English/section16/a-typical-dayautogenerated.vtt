00:01.470 --> 00:06.680
Today I'm going to walk you through a Typical Developer Day.

00:06.700 --> 00:10.110
Now I know there's different types of companies.

00:10.270 --> 00:16.210
But in this video, there's going to be some main concepts that most likely you're going to see in all

00:16.210 --> 00:23.200
forms of work you do as a developer - whether it's for a company or a startup or freelance similar work

00:23.200 --> 00:24.570
patterns are going to be seen.

00:24.580 --> 00:28.480
And I want to take you through that because I'm assuming you're taking this course because you want

00:28.480 --> 00:31.040
to become a developer or you want to upgrade your skills.

00:31.150 --> 00:38.500
And it's important to know what a current workflow is and also what to expect to decide if this

00:38.500 --> 00:40.090
is for you or not.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.570
So let's get started.

00:41.620 --> 00:48.430
It's 9:00 A.M. now and as you can see I've created this great diagram of myself coming into work,

00:48.490 --> 00:55.550
It's 9:00 A.M. and I have here what I call a Trello board and I can show you right over here what it is.

00:55.690 --> 01:01.580
Usually when you work on big projects, in order to stay organized, people have this what they call 

01:01.650 --> 01:06.540
'Kanban style' where there's a list of things To Do what people are working on.

01:06.550 --> 01:08.340
And then there's a Done list.

01:08.350 --> 01:13.630
So usually in the morning you come in and the first thing you want to do is you want to make sure that

01:13.990 --> 01:19.960
any changes that have been made while you were home or a night maybe have teams that are overseas that

01:19.970 --> 01:22.120
have worked while you were sleeping.

01:22.280 --> 01:28.000
Well as you know we want to always go to 

01:30.290 --> 01:32.190
git checkout master 

01:32.370 --> 01:34.810
And you should know how this works by now.

01:34.830 --> 01:37.870
If not make sure you check out the previous section.

01:37.920 --> 01:42.560
I would do something like git pull to make sure that everything is up to date.

01:42.570 --> 01:42.830
All right.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.880
And now I have everything up to date.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.130
Do you also want to see if there's anything that's maybe you're still working on that hasn't been resolved?

01:50.430 --> 01:57.900
If you remember from previous videos,  I have a couple of pull requests and one of the ones was the conflict

01:57.900 --> 01:58.140
one

02:00.820 --> 02:08.000
and we remember that -well, this branch that I was working on Marcy told me that we don't really need

02:08.000 --> 02:10.350
that change so there's no files changed.

02:10.370 --> 02:15.970
I can clean up what I've been working on by just closing my pull requests I'm going to delete this branch

02:17.000 --> 02:22.310
so that now going back to my workflow I'll just have master that I'm working on.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.270
Everything is up to date.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.080
All right so pretty good.

02:27.100 --> 02:30.240
Maybe I'll move this conflict branch that I was working on.

02:30.250 --> 02:34.360
I'll just move it to done and say that you know I'm -I'm done with it.

02:34.360 --> 02:41.510
So the team knows that I am no longer working on this branch. 9:00 A.M. is done.

02:41.520 --> 02:49.320
And 10:00 A.M. rolls around and I have over here usually what happens is something called a stand up

02:49.740 --> 02:55.560
where team members and everybody that's involved in a project or whatever you're working on meets to

02:55.560 --> 03:00.990
get everybody's updates and usually everybody stands around and you see over here that there is an

03:01.080 --> 03:07.950
SM that is usually a scrum master or a manager or a director that usually organizes the meeting and

03:08.160 --> 03:09.480
takes the lead.

03:09.690 --> 03:14.130
And what we all do is just say "hey this is what we did yesterday."

03:14.130 --> 03:15.860
"This is where we're going to do today."

03:15.960 --> 03:19.900
Or maybe if you're blocked on something and you're having an issue maybe you can ask some team members

03:21.660 --> 03:26.340
and usually in this meeting you also have this scary looking person which is actually the PO which

03:26.340 --> 03:27.750
is the product owner.

03:27.750 --> 03:35.010
So that is anybody that it could be a client that has vested interests that is money on the line for

03:35.340 --> 03:36.800
this project to be built.

03:36.810 --> 03:43.470
It could be your your CEO it could be whoever is owning the product whoever wants to make sure that

03:43.800 --> 03:49.030
their product gets finished and gets finished on time but is also built properly.

03:49.050 --> 03:50.050
That's the product.

03:50.310 --> 03:53.930
So you have a quick stand up meeting and usually around 10:30.

03:53.940 --> 04:00.120
You'll go back to work you'll be working on something like bugs or new features and the way you do that

04:00.120 --> 04:05.550
is well you go back to a board like this and see what's on the To Do list.

04:05.550 --> 04:11.010
And usually they're all small chunks and you know let's say I want to update the read me old drag that

04:11.010 --> 04:16.890
in here and to let everybody know that I am working on the updating the reading.

04:17.130 --> 04:26.260
You know if I'm updating the read me I'll do something like 'git branch update-readme' and I'll just

04:26.460 --> 04:34.560
git checkout that branch and I'll start to work on that feature or bug whatever it is.

04:37.220 --> 04:40.800
All right and let's say that -you know, I have had my lunch.

04:40.850 --> 04:46.700
I'm feeling very happy I got a lot of work done and I actually finished my readme task, well in that

04:46.700 --> 04:53.420
case I will actually submit a PR or a pull request which we've seen in previous videos where I'll do

04:53.420 --> 05:00.890
the classic 'git add' command then 'git commit' then I'll be 'git push'

05:00.890 --> 05:09.710
up to github all my changes and then what we usually tend to do is if we go back to github

05:11.770 --> 05:16.780
we'll have people that like yourself or other team members that see that.

05:16.890 --> 05:23.170
There's a couple of pull requests Let's review a pull request so that is code that maybe yourself or

05:23.200 --> 05:29.860
others have done and I see over here that I have a nice little person who came and refactored our background

05:29.860 --> 05:39.920
generator. So we would view the file changes and we see here that they have fixed a bunch of our background

05:39.920 --> 05:45.640
scripts to include the new ES6 syntax which is very very nice.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.610
We review everything, if we want to comment that's great.

05:48.830 --> 05:51.180
But you know what, these changes look really good.

05:51.200 --> 05:55.270
So I'm going to say Approve, do the @ sign and

05:55.410 --> 05:59.170
"Thank you for this-

05:59.370 --> 06:01.580
-These changes.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.960
It looks great. Merging now."

06:08.360 --> 06:09.670
So I've submitted my review

06:12.700 --> 06:13.660
and everything looks good.

06:13.660 --> 06:18.670
If there's any issues then I can let them know that we need a couple more things fixed but everything

06:18.670 --> 06:19.590
looks good here.

06:20.740 --> 06:27.850
Some companies will pass it off to something called QA with that does Quality Analysis essentially making

06:27.850 --> 06:33.060
sure that the changes that we've implemented doesn't affect our web app.

06:33.070 --> 06:34.240
It still works on the phone.

06:34.240 --> 06:39.740
It still works on all the browsers and making sure that our features or bugs are fixed.

06:40.980 --> 06:48.800
So that usually happens and if everything passes then woohoo, our PR gets approved by our team.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.630
The QA says Yep everything's looks good.

06:51.630 --> 06:59.220
You're happy with what you've done and your PR and then you can finally merge in to master and when

06:59.220 --> 07:04.930
that's done we go back to the Trello board and we can just say that Update the Readme is done.

07:04.950 --> 07:12.500
The team knows that you're all good to go and it all starts back up the next day where you get in, make

07:12.500 --> 07:14.030
sure that there's nothing outstanding due.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.960
You go to the meeting.

07:16.010 --> 07:20.510
You look through that To Dos, grab a piece of feature or a bug that needs working on.

07:20.510 --> 07:21.980
And you start working on it.

07:22.190 --> 07:27.590
And I know it doesn't sound very exciting from the way that I'm describing it right now, but 

07:27.590 --> 07:28.570
it is a ton of fun.

07:28.700 --> 07:34.250
Whether you're building a product yourself or you're the only owner you still are using these techniques

07:34.250 --> 07:39.650
to just keep yourself accountable making sure that tasks are getting done because being a web developer

07:39.650 --> 07:48.050
is all about breaking up big tasks like building Netflix into small manageable chunks and each day you're

07:48.050 --> 07:52.360
just working one chunk at a time to write some JavaScript,

07:52.370 --> 07:58.180
Maybe some CSS, maybe some HTML, to build this one great big product.

07:59.360 --> 07:59.970
And that's it.

08:00.140 --> 08:03.580
That's a typical day of a web developer.

08:03.680 --> 08:09.170
I know it's always good to know why you're getting yourself into some of the tools that companies use

08:09.200 --> 08:10.870
and some of the workflows.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.380
So hopefully this video was useful to you.

08:14.510 --> 08:16.080
I'll see you in the next one, byebye.
