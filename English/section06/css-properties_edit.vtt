WEBVTT

00:00.820 --> 00:02.560
And welcome back.

00:02.590 --> 00:06.250
Let's make this website a little bit prettier than it is now.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.270
And I'm going to introduce you to some CSS properties.

00:10.300 --> 00:16.780
Properties are, as the name suggests, properties that we want to change within a web page and you might

00:16.780 --> 00:20.020
be asking yourself you know how many properties are there.

00:20.200 --> 00:28.240
And as we did with the HTML section I have a recommended resource for you and that is CSS Tricks.

00:28.540 --> 00:36.160
This website any time you google any questions about CSS, most likely some of the top 10 answers are

00:36.160 --> 00:38.410
going to include something from this website.

00:38.560 --> 00:46.960
So I highly highly recommend it especially if you go to the menu and Almanac because within this almanac

00:47.380 --> 00:51.790
we have all the CSS properties listed on here.

00:51.790 --> 00:57.400
So any time you have a question and you want to say 'hmm... what is justified content?' well you can click on

00:57.400 --> 01:04.530
it and it will actually give you examples you can play around with it and learn about the specific property.

01:05.300 --> 01:10.310
Just like with the HTML tags although there are way more properties you don't need to know all of them

01:10.310 --> 01:13.000
and memorize them because that's not realistic.

01:13.010 --> 01:14.840
That's not the best use of your time.

01:14.840 --> 01:20.510
We're going to focus on the ones that you'll encounter most often and any time you seen new ones pop

01:20.510 --> 01:21.740
up while you're working.

01:21.830 --> 01:27.200
You can always look them up and learn about them because they're very very simple to read into.

01:27.200 --> 01:35.360
So let's try a few of these I'm gonna start off with our style.CSS over here and let's change a few

01:35.360 --> 01:36.200
things.

01:36.410 --> 01:38.860
We want to have our home be in the center.

01:38.960 --> 01:42.470
Let's start off with text-align

01:45.450 --> 01:50.570
and if I type in center and I save, my text is now centered.

01:50.620 --> 01:50.920
OK.

01:50.920 --> 01:56.010
We also want to add a border to this image - 'border:'

01:56.170 --> 01:58.140
and this is a little bit unique.

01:58.150 --> 02:03.590
You can do something like this you can do five pixels [5px] which is the size of the border.

02:04.030 --> 02:08.080
What style of border you want so you can do that.

02:08.230 --> 02:11.040
And then the color of the border - we'll do purple.

02:11.070 --> 02:15.390
I save, refresh and we have a border.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.730
You can also do solid.

02:17.860 --> 02:21.410
And if it's solid, it's a solid border.

02:21.460 --> 02:21.730
OK.

02:21.730 --> 02:22.770
And what else can we do.

02:22.770 --> 02:27.170
It'll be nice to have an image, maybe an entire image for the website.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.240
So how do we do that.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.670
Well the tag that we would want to apply to is probably body.

02:31.720 --> 02:40.770
So if I go into body and you might notice something here as I'm creating these selectors I'm going from

02:40.770 --> 02:47.250
top to bottom, body which is the parent of almost everything is at the top.

02:47.250 --> 02:53.100
And as we get more and more specific we trickle down to smaller elements.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.910
Again we'll get into that in a later video.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.950
But just keep that in mind.

02:57.130 --> 03:05.430
OK so for body it'll be awesome to have a cool image on our website so we can do background and you can see

03:05.430 --> 03:11.490
the Sublime Text actually autofills or has some suggestions for us and we can look through this and

03:11.490 --> 03:17.400
pick the one that we want but based on the name looks like we want a background image with 'background-image'

03:17.430 --> 03:20.030
we want to specify a URL.

03:20.040 --> 03:28.220
In our case I actually have on my desktop saved a nice little picture and let's title it something simple

03:28.220 --> 03:31.260
like 'backgroundimage'.

03:31.550 --> 03:35.680
And I got this from a website called ‘unsplash’ if you haven't checked it out.

03:35.930 --> 03:38.750
They have a ton of high quality, free images they can use.

03:38.750 --> 03:42.730
So again here we are referencing our -

03:42.740 --> 03:45.030
Let's put this actually in here.

03:45.170 --> 03:46.700
So it's in our project folder.

03:46.760 --> 03:53.750
And then within our project folder we can say that it is 'backgroundimage.jpeg'.

03:54.050 --> 04:01.120
So I save this I refresh and look at that we have this image but you can see that is a big image and

04:01.120 --> 04:02.650
doesn't fit the screen.

04:02.710 --> 04:13.800
So how can we do that we can do 'background-size: cover;' so if we do that and refresh look at that we have

04:13.800 --> 04:16.670
a beautiful background on our website.

04:16.820 --> 04:17.090
OK.

04:17.100 --> 04:22.240
And let's say we want to remove these little dots next to our links.

04:22.260 --> 04:30.630
We can do that by going into what we want to change our 'li' tag elements, so we'll go into 'style' and

04:30.630 --> 04:38.520
we can put it in here and 'li' and we'll do something called 'list-style' and we'll go 'none' and refresh

04:38.970 --> 04:42.480
and look at that those little pesky dots are gone.

04:42.480 --> 04:49.200
Whenever I select About I want the cursor to not be this I want to change the cursor to maybe have this

04:49.200 --> 04:52.890
little hand gesture - I like to call them Mickey Mouse hands.

04:53.160 --> 04:53.660
OK.

04:53.820 --> 05:01.020
So we go into our 'h2' and we give you something called 'cursor' and let's say you don't really know what

05:01.020 --> 05:06.580
properties 'cursor' has or you don't even know the property. Can go into CSS tricks.

05:06.630 --> 05:14.360
And again go to C look at cursor and you can kind of guess by the name what it does.

05:15.390 --> 05:18.270
And it tells you all the information you need to know.

05:18.630 --> 05:24.130
But you can see over here that they even have a demo of what you can do with cursors.

05:24.150 --> 05:35.040
So we want the pointer, so we can just put 'pointer' here save Let's go back to our website refresh and

05:35.040 --> 05:35.880
look at that.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.330
We now have a pointer when we hover over About. OK.

05:40.380 --> 05:45.180
And maybe the last change we want to do is that we want to make sure that our Home About and Login

05:45.180 --> 05:46.780
are on one line.

05:46.800 --> 05:52.380
This is a little awkward when they're stacked on top of each other and we can do that by selecting, let's

05:52.380 --> 05:53.320
look over here.

05:53.400 --> 06:02.460
We want to select our 'li' tags and we can use something called display and display has a few properties

06:02.460 --> 06:04.170
that you can use.

06:04.210 --> 06:15.190
One is block and by default this is actually already a block but there is also something called inline

06:15.340 --> 06:15.880
block.

06:16.030 --> 06:23.640
And if I saved this and refresh look at that we have everything inline now we want to change a few things here

06:23.650 --> 06:30.790
we want to make sure that our colors are better than just purple and green and pink and what if we

06:30.790 --> 06:34.880
want some specific color and we have a certain design that we want for our website.

06:35.170 --> 06:40.090
Well colors are very very interesting in CSS because there's a few ways that you can do them and I

06:40.090 --> 06:43.080
want to show you one of my favorite websites for picking colors.

06:43.540 --> 06:50.770
What this website does it actually gives you the colors they can use, along with a nice addition of

06:50.770 --> 06:52.890
what will compliment that color.

06:52.960 --> 06:59.620
So you can play around with this and change a bunch of criteria and you can click over here and see what

06:59.620 --> 07:01.380
color combinations work.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.750
But let's say we wanted to use something like this.

07:05.080 --> 07:10.530
And if you hover over and click, you'll see over here that I get a couple of numbers that we can use.

07:10.540 --> 07:20.660
So the first one is a hex number so hex number has a hash and then the number associated with it.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.160
So I just copied it from the Web site.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.970
You see the numbers a little bit different.

07:24.970 --> 07:32.920
Essentially they can use anything from 0 to 9 and then all the way to F, so A to F and this represents

07:32.950 --> 07:34.790
a specific color.

07:34.810 --> 07:41.970
So if I copy this and let's make our color uhm.. let's make it the color of our header, we go back to the CSS

07:41.990 --> 07:45.570
and save this and refresh.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.780
You'll see that our color changes OK.

07:48.790 --> 07:54.590
We also want the border again to complement the color.

07:54.690 --> 08:02.670
Let's do this border color we also have something called RGB and RGB again you see over here that

08:02.700 --> 08:05.880
there is a hex color and an RGB color.

08:05.970 --> 08:07.600
These are both the same color.

08:07.650 --> 08:14.280
So you can pick whichever one you want in the case of an RGB color you can do something like this.

08:14.280 --> 08:22.860
Say we want for our border have RGB color of these values so that is the value of red, green, and

08:22.860 --> 08:23.240
blue.

08:23.250 --> 08:28.400
So that's what RGB stands for and we just wrap it like so.

08:28.620 --> 08:36.690
So now if I save this and refresh look at that I have a nice little outline just to show you of what exactly

08:36.690 --> 08:38.750
I mean by red, green, and blue.

08:38.790 --> 08:46.580
If I set all these to zero so that means that red is in full force and green and blue are non-existent.

08:46.680 --> 08:53.750
If I save and refresh that is red if I change this to green then that's in green effect.

08:53.760 --> 09:00.380
And you can imagine here that if I change the blue to 255 and everything else is zero this will be blue

09:03.120 --> 09:03.800
for you.

09:04.030 --> 09:10.680
So let's go back here to what we had before because I like the other colors way better.

09:10.730 --> 09:13.720
So let's refresh. Perfect. Now

09:13.730 --> 09:20.040
RGB lets you do one other cool thing and that is called RGBA and that it's stands for Alpha.

09:20.230 --> 09:26.230
You can actually set the opacity so with the fourth number you can actually do something between 0 and

09:26.230 --> 09:35.840
1 and 1 being well opaque and you can still see everything to zero where it's completely transparent.

09:35.840 --> 09:43.540
So lets do 0.5 here and you can see that there is a bit of a fade now in our color. Perfect, so using a tool

09:43.540 --> 09:50.920
like this you can really pick what colors you want your website to have and choose the one that complement

09:50.950 --> 09:52.430
each other well.

09:52.690 --> 09:58.240
I use this website a lot when creating new websites and thinking of color templates to use.

09:58.240 --> 10:04.120
It's a really really good resource and you can use hex and RGB uh whichever way, whichever one you

10:04.120 --> 10:09.230
want just it's good to have some consistency if you want to add some opacity.

10:09.280 --> 10:14.320
So the alpha this last number then definitely use RGBA.

10:14.590 --> 10:24.010
OK so going back here our Web site is starting to look somewhat OK but in the next section I want to

10:24.010 --> 10:28.990
talk a little bit about selectors and more things that we can do with them.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.980
I'll see you in that one. Bye-Bye
