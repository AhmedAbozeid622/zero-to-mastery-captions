00:01.360 --> 00:02.440
Welcome back.

00:02.500 --> 00:06.610
And in this video we're going to be talking about text and font.

00:07.890 --> 00:12.660
Let's go back to the About page - looks quite lonely and empty right now.

00:12.660 --> 00:19.320
I'm gonna to turn off the hover effect because it can get kind of annoying after a bit let's remove

00:19.320 --> 00:25.260
that here and refresh right perfect. In the 'about.html',

00:25.260 --> 00:28.370
let's try and make this text a little bit prettier.

00:29.130 --> 00:34.770
So I'm going to do our little short command, with Sublime Text, so 'Lorem' and then make sure I close

00:34.770 --> 00:36.110
off this 'p' tag.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.010
All right.

00:37.110 --> 00:44.070
So I'm going to show you a few text properties that we can add going back to style and I'm going to

00:44.070 --> 00:53.880
remove the pink color so we only have this 'p' to worry about, and refresh and you'll see here that it's still

00:53.880 --> 00:57.990
not green because this has higher specificity than this.

00:57.990 --> 01:05.470
Again if you don't know what that means just check out my previous video. The first one,

01:05.480 --> 01:13.140
I'm going to show you is called 'text-decoration' and very simply, this one you can do

01:13.310 --> 01:17.310
'underline', refresh you get a nice underline.

01:17.320 --> 01:22.770
You can also do 'line-through', refresh and there you go.

01:22.860 --> 01:29.620
Nice line through. The next one is 'text-transform'.

01:29.810 --> 01:37.820
And this one can do something like 'uppercase' and you can transform the entire text into uppercase.

01:37.870 --> 01:42.490
You can do lowercase with this as well, but you can try that out on your own.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.160
The next one is 'line-height'.

01:44.330 --> 01:46.340
So in 'line-height' you can put the pixels.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.350
So we want '20px' of space.

01:49.490 --> 01:50.490
There's 'line-height'.

01:50.510 --> 01:56.150
If we do '200px' you can see that that's a lot of spacing.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.720
So let's keep it at 20 just because that looks nice.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.950
Refresh. Perfect.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.650
Next one is - I kind of like this I'm going to keep this I'm going to add it to the bottom.

02:06.650 --> 02:10.160
The next one is 'font-style'.

02:10.190 --> 02:16.800
You can set something like 'italic'. Save, refresh, nice italic lettering.

02:18.070 --> 02:21.220
The next one let's do 'font-weight'.

02:21.490 --> 02:27.580
And here you can actually do a number of between '100' and '900' or you can do just simply, something like

02:27.640 --> 02:28.400
'bold'.

02:28.780 --> 02:32.140
And obviously that changes the weight of the font.

02:32.140 --> 02:34.210
We also have something like 'font-size'.

02:34.240 --> 02:39.380
Obviously we want to change the size of the text and you can do something like percentage.

02:39.380 --> 02:42.100
So 100% if you do that,

02:42.100 --> 02:52.300
nothing changes but if you do 150%, well that gets 150 percent bigger, you do '80%' it will get 80 percent

02:52.300 --> 02:53.390
of the original.

02:53.440 --> 02:58.130
And then finally I also want to show you font family.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.940
So this is where you get to pick what kind of font you want.

03:00.940 --> 03:06.020
So if you want something like Georgia I save, refresh.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.450
We got that nice little font.

03:08.470 --> 03:13.990
If you have something that is multiple words you'll have to use quotation marks.

03:13.990 --> 03:21.070
So if you have something like "Times New Roman" you'll have to write it like that and a special quality

03:21.070 --> 03:26.490
of 'font-family' is that you'll see a lot of this.

03:26.550 --> 03:34.830
This means that on who's ever laptop the website opens on if that computer doesn't have Times New Roman.

03:34.890 --> 03:40.830
Then print the text in Georgia and you can have multiple of these separated by commma.

03:41.340 --> 03:49.440
And that might sound surprising to you but fonts are simply pieces of information that each computer has.

03:49.470 --> 03:53.490
But it's not equally distributed amongst everybody.

03:53.580 --> 03:59.810
So some computers might have certain kinds of font like Times New Roman and others might not.

04:00.030 --> 04:05.940
And you can check online which fonts are available in Windows and Macs but keep that in mind that you

04:05.940 --> 04:10.330
want to think about fonts and how your website's going to display,

04:10.350 --> 04:15.380
because a user might not have that specific font on their laptop.

04:15.420 --> 04:18.780
Now two questions might pop in your head right now.

04:18.780 --> 04:19.840
One is,

04:20.110 --> 04:25.320
"Well Andre What if I have this super awesome custom font and I want to use that?"

04:25.350 --> 04:33.060
And the second one is, "How do we make sure that a user always sees the same font on a website,

04:33.480 --> 04:35.290
even if they don't have it on their computer?"

04:35.430 --> 04:36.520
So how can you do this?

04:36.680 --> 04:44.980
One way is to actually include a font file that you have on your computer with all your website files.

04:45.240 --> 04:53.670
But I'm going to show you an easy way that a lot of developers use and it's free and that is Google Fonts.

04:57.030 --> 05:03.000
Google Fonts actually has these free fonts that you can use and there's a ton of them.

05:03.060 --> 05:06.400
Anything that you find here is more than enough.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.610
And I've used this many times when building websites.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.220
It's a great great resource.

05:11.220 --> 05:13.010
I really like this one.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.480
So let's pick this one. Poiret One.

05:15.700 --> 05:23.240
And you can see over here that you can play around and see what it looks like.

05:24.290 --> 05:28.280
You can also see the size difference.

05:28.520 --> 05:36.520
And if you click the plus sign over here you'll see at the bottom that I have a selected item.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.860
And if I click on it, it shows me how I can add it to my website.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.240
So first thing we want to do is we want to copy this.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.440
And this might look familiar.

05:46.520 --> 05:55.750
And this link tag which is a stylesheet has a reference to 'fonts.googleapis.com'. We are saying,

05:55.750 --> 06:02.830
"Hey grab the fonts before you load up this html file on my web page - load it up with the fonts

06:02.830 --> 06:05.760
that are found at this website."

06:05.780 --> 06:12.170
So yes if this website is down and let's say there's no internet access they won't be able to load those

06:12.170 --> 06:14.420
fonts but it's Google we can trust them.

06:14.420 --> 06:16.700
Most likely they're going to be online.

06:16.700 --> 06:21.490
And the second one you can see over here what we can add to our CSS file.

06:21.560 --> 06:29.510
So we just copy that, go to our stylesheet and let's change this to our new Google font.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.640
I save that.

06:32.150 --> 06:37.230
Let's go to our page and refresh, look at that.

06:37.410 --> 06:38.860
That is nice and pretty.

06:38.860 --> 06:39.750
Let's make that bigger.

06:39.750 --> 06:40.990
Just so we can see it.

06:43.120 --> 06:51.140
Wow! we obviously need some line spacing here so we can do line height 50 pixels.

06:51.270 --> 06:52.060
There you go.

06:52.140 --> 06:57.600
One thing you might think about and this is something that we'll get into in the advanced CSS section

06:58.260 --> 07:06.990
is that by loading this we're actually making our website a tiny bit slower because now in order for

07:06.990 --> 07:16.950
this website to load we need to grab the stylesheet that we've created plus go to this link and grab

07:17.010 --> 07:24.650
our font again something that we don't want to worry about yet but things to keep in mind and in the

07:24.650 --> 07:25.440
advanced section,

07:25.460 --> 07:28.150
we'll cover that a little bit further.

07:28.220 --> 07:30.380
But there you have it.

07:30.380 --> 07:35.530
There are your general text based, font based properties.

07:35.570 --> 07:36.740
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
