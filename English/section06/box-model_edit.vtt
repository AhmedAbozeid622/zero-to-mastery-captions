Welcome back.

00:01.830 --> 00:05.940
In this video I want to talk about the box model in CSS.

00:05.940 --> 00:10.350
It's a very important concept and it's something that you might have been kind of curious in the back

00:10.350 --> 00:14.490
of your head about, and that is this image right here.

00:15.190 --> 00:24.110
In CSS we have this idea of the box model which has the content, it has the padding, the border which

00:24.110 --> 00:24.980
we've seen before,

00:24.980 --> 00:25.980
and then the margin.

00:26.150 --> 00:27.970
So we're going to talk about that in this video.

00:28.100 --> 00:35.390
So we have our not so pretty website right now but I've left, intentionally, our login page still kind

00:35.390 --> 00:40.870
of blank and you see that there's no styles applied to it because if we go to the login page 

00:40.880 --> 00:47.780
and I'm gonna drag it over here it's referencing 'style2' which doesn't have much style(s) happening. To really

00:47.810 --> 00:48.860
emphasize this point,

00:48.860 --> 01:01.560
I wanted to just instead of the 'Lorem Ipsum' I'm going to create a 'div'. If I give this a 'class' of

01:02.220 --> 01:15.630
'boxmodel' I can go into my 'style2' which I'm gonna drag over here and I can say '.boxmodel' 'border: 5px solid red' 

01:15.980 --> 01:18.570
I save this and refresh.

01:18.580 --> 01:22.270
Ok, so we have our box model. Let's add something into this 'div'.

01:23.670 --> 01:24.930
We have 'A'.

01:25.080 --> 01:28.170
And right now it's covering the entire space.

01:28.170 --> 01:39.450
But if we had three more 'divs' we'll call this one 'B' the next one 'C' I save and refresh.

01:39.990 --> 01:41.980
OK we have these,

01:42.060 --> 01:51.300
and if we wanted them all in one line then you might remember that that was 'display: inline-block' and

01:51.300 --> 01:55.070
I save, refresh and there we have it.

01:55.380 --> 01:57.430
OK let's talk about the box model here.

01:57.440 --> 02:01.820
Let's say we wanted more space inside of these for the letters.

02:02.210 --> 02:09.680
Well in that case we can use something like 'padding' so padding I can put 20 pixels [padding: 20px], save and refresh

02:10.520 --> 02:11.790
and there's our padding.

02:12.170 --> 02:18.380
But let's say we wanted different padding so that the sides are wider than the top.

02:18.410 --> 02:27.380
In that case we can do something like five pixels on the top, 20 pixels on the right side, 5 pixels

02:27.440 --> 02:31.340
at the bottom and 20 pixels to the left.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.650
I refresh and look at that.

02:34.870 --> 02:40.430
And that's just a standard that you'll have to get used to it's top, right, bottom' (and) left.

02:40.450 --> 02:47.340
You can also actually do padding as you can see in the drop-down bottom, left, top, right to specify.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.310
But this is a quicker way of doing it.

02:49.390 --> 02:52.780
If you remember there is one more and that was 'margin'.

02:53.200 --> 02:59.200
So margin allows us to create space outside of the border.

02:59.320 --> 03:07.940
So if I go '20px' here and I save, refresh you can see that we created 20 pixels on the left side

03:07.940 --> 03:10.870
and right side but also the top and the bottom.

03:10.880 --> 03:16.390
Let's say we only want spaces between the boxes but not at the top and bottom.

03:16.570 --> 03:18.840
Well, same principle again.

03:18.860 --> 03:26.460
We can do 0 pixels, 20 pixels, 0 pixels and 20 pixels.

03:26.460 --> 03:31.410
So top, right, bottom (and) left, save and refresh.

03:31.410 --> 03:32.330
There you go.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.540
Now this might get tedious.

03:34.540 --> 03:39.570
There is one other shorthand way and that is you can remove this.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.640
So this means top and bottom, this means left and right.

03:43.710 --> 03:45.300
I save this and refresh.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.240
Nothing should change and it doesn't.

03:47.340 --> 03:49.730
And we can do the same at the top here as well.

03:53.040 --> 03:53.890
Perfect.

03:53.910 --> 03:58.950
One last thing I want to show you is that if we open up our developer tools.

03:58.950 --> 04:01.220
So again we do 'inspect'.

04:01.470 --> 04:06.510
You'll see in our styles that we have our box model.

04:06.510 --> 04:15.140
So if you see over here we have our content we have our padding and it says 20 pixels, 5 pixels, 5 pixels.

04:15.300 --> 04:23.250
We have our border 5 pixel, 5 pixels, 5 pixel, 5 pixels and then our margin, 0 with 20 (pixels)

04:23.250 --> 04:24.620
on the side.

04:24.630 --> 04:31.550
So again Chrome allows you to browse around and make sure that all of these are properly done.

04:31.560 --> 04:36.580
The last thing you might ask is What about this content how can I change this.

04:36.630 --> 04:46.560
And that's very simple you can do something like 'width' let's do '33px' save and refresh and also do

04:47.040 --> 04:56.520
'height', do '55px' save and refresh and you'll see over here that in our box model we now have the

04:56.520 --> 05:01.970
content with 33 pixels by 55 pixels.

05:02.030 --> 05:03.680
All right that's it for now.

05:03.770 --> 05:04.910
See you on the next one.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.200
Bye-bye
