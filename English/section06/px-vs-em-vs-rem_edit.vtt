00:00.630 --> 00:01.560
Welcome back.

00:01.560 --> 00:07.270
Before we finish off the section I wanted to show you one last thing and that is up until this point.

00:07.290 --> 00:13.710
We've used pixels (px) quite a lot but there's two other options that we can actually use.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.750
So let's remove our box models for now.

00:19.370 --> 00:22.370
And instead let's create some paragraphs [‘p’].

00:22.510 --> 00:32.010
So using our 'Lorem' shorthand - and let's close this off, perfect. Let's say that we also wanted to have

00:32.010 --> 00:39.820
another paragraph that says 'Introduction'. Save and refresh and there you go.

00:39.820 --> 00:40.800
We have our paragraph.

00:40.840 --> 00:47.920
Now if we wanted to add some 'class' to this paragraph we can just go in here and we don't need the box

00:47.920 --> 00:49.820
model so we can delete that.

00:49.870 --> 00:58.210
We can do something like 'p' and less do 'font-size' and for font size I've shown you that we can do percentages

00:58.720 --> 01:03.530
but you can also do pick's also close to '20px' save and refresh.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.380
And we have pixels. OK.

01:06.580 --> 01:13.860
So let's say I want 'Lorem ipsum' to be a little bit bigger we can use 'span' 

01:14.050 --> 01:17.140
Again that's kind of like the 'div' tag that you've seen before.

01:17.140 --> 01:19.530
It's just good for inline.

01:19.870 --> 01:22.290
So again this way we can add styles.

01:22.660 --> 01:30.340
So I save that go to styles and now we can select 'span' and we can do something like this -

01:30.340 --> 01:35.870
we can do 'font-size: 5em'

01:37.840 --> 01:38.820
Refresh.

01:38.890 --> 01:47.830
So what it's saying is we want the font size to be equal to 5 times the containing element which is

01:48.100 --> 01:55.240
20 pixels because, if you remember we're inside of a 'p' tag just to show you that that's right if I do

01:55.240 --> 01:58.780
'100px' and save and refresh.

01:59.080 --> 02:11.150
It's the same. So 'em' is kind of nice because if I do something like '2em' and refresh, well if I change

02:11.210 --> 02:21.890
this to 10 pixels and I refresh this always stays relative to the 'p' (paragraph). One other one I want to show you is 'rem'.

02:23.240 --> 02:27.850
And that is the size in relation to the size of the root element.

02:27.890 --> 02:29.420
What is the root element?

02:29.690 --> 02:31.740
Well it's the 'html'.

02:32.060 --> 02:37.670
So whatever the document is it's always going to be twice as big.

02:37.670 --> 02:46.400
So if I do '5rem', refresh, that's great but if I change the font size over here to '5' that won't be affected

02:46.700 --> 02:47.260
at all.

02:48.190 --> 02:50.710
Good job getting this far in the course.

02:50.710 --> 02:55.480
I know I've thrown a lot of properties and selectors at you but I promise in the next section we're

02:55.480 --> 02:59.920
going to start building some real websites and have fun with all this knowledge.

02:59.980 --> 03:00.620
Can't wait.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.880
See in the next one.

03:01.890 --> 03:02.410
Bye-bye
