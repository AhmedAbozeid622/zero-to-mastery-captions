00:00.580 --> 00:00.930
Hey there.

00:00.940 --> 00:03.160
This is Andre from the future.

00:03.160 --> 00:03.850
That's right.

00:03.850 --> 00:07.610
You just watched a video of me installing node but.

00:07.690 --> 00:14.050
Oh now we're in the future and the no versions are now higher based on when you watch the video.

00:14.050 --> 00:20.640
This might be even higher where the LTE release is probably while probably this version.

00:20.650 --> 00:22.510
So what can you do here.

00:22.510 --> 00:24.590
Well it doesn't really matter right.

00:24.610 --> 00:30.550
I said in the previous video that as long as you have a version higher than this everything in this

00:30.550 --> 00:37.200
course will work but let's say you're coming back to this video or just in general you want to keep

00:37.200 --> 00:43.200
your software up to date and you decide that I want to get the latest version of node because this latest

00:43.440 --> 00:47.450
version of node has the best most up to date features.

00:48.030 --> 00:54.490
Let's say we go back to our terminal and in here I check my node version.

00:54.490 --> 00:57.010
I see that have version nine point six.

00:57.010 --> 01:04.320
Now in this version nine point six Well it's definitely lower than what the latest is once again.

01:04.330 --> 01:14.140
If I do NPM version here I get five point six which if we look at the home page and maybe the downloads

01:14.140 --> 01:22.230
here you see that it includes NPM Version six point nine so if I go to the homepage here it'll actually

01:22.230 --> 01:28.410
automatically detect one machine you're on or you can go specifically to downloads and download specific

01:28.650 --> 01:32.430
to your operating system.

01:32.440 --> 01:42.410
Now let's go through a process where we update our node version or we need to do is click on this open

01:42.410 --> 01:49.030
up the package go through the installer let's continue.

01:49.050 --> 01:50.610
Yes we agree to the license

01:55.550 --> 01:56.540
and let's close

01:59.470 --> 01:59.790
OK.

02:00.090 --> 02:10.910
So let's go back to the terminal here and tried node dash the well all I have to do is close my terminal

02:11.000 --> 02:13.370
and open up a new window.

02:13.370 --> 02:15.710
So in my case I can just open up a new window.

02:15.950 --> 02:17.690
Let's make this a little bit bigger.

02:17.870 --> 02:27.170
If I now do node dash v check that out I have the latest version of node if once again I do NPM dash

02:27.320 --> 02:32.770
V I have the latest version of NPM as well.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.370
Very very cool.

02:34.450 --> 02:37.970
Now based on your machine you might encounter some issues.

02:38.050 --> 02:42.200
So I will leave some resources for you to actually help you along.

02:42.250 --> 02:48.140
For example if you're just installing the latest version of NPM there is a way to do it.

02:48.190 --> 02:54.430
As I've shown you before with OSX and Linux and then for Windows there is a separate way of updating

02:54.430 --> 02:55.600
things.

02:55.600 --> 03:03.310
Again if it's just the NPM you want to upgrade and they actually have a couple of nice links of how

03:03.310 --> 03:04.720
to do it step by step.

03:05.980 --> 03:14.020
But I'm only showing you this because in the future in your projects you might want to upgrade some

03:14.020 --> 03:19.030
of your tooling if you're watching this video right now and this is your first time downloading node

03:19.180 --> 03:23.090
then most likely you have the latest version anyway so you don't have to do anything.

03:23.140 --> 03:23.650
Lucky you.
