00:00.730 --> 00:03.130
Our robo friends are looking really really nice.

00:03.130 --> 00:05.780
I really like this up there is one issue though.

00:05.920 --> 00:14.580
If I minimize this OK it's responsive it looks good but if I scroll down well I lose my search bar at

00:14.580 --> 00:14.980
the top.

00:14.980 --> 00:21.540
Would it be nice if this was at the top and I have a scroll that I can do and still search to my friends.

00:24.510 --> 00:30.150
Well you might be thinking well there's probably a CSSA style that I can add here but I want to illustrate

00:30.150 --> 00:39.180
to you the fact that react and why react to so good is because you can create components that are were

00:39.300 --> 00:42.560
usable not just car components but functionality.

00:42.600 --> 00:48.110
Would it be cool if there was maybe something where we can add around card lists.

00:48.120 --> 00:58.960
Maybe I can create a scroll component and this scroll component just wraps the cardless.

00:59.190 --> 01:02.130
And now cardless will be completely scrollable.

01:02.220 --> 01:08.820
But now I can use scroll this component anywhere in my app any time I need scrolling I can just wrap

01:08.820 --> 01:10.740
it around.

01:10.790 --> 01:11.870
Can we do this.

01:11.930 --> 01:12.860
Let's give it a try.

01:14.690 --> 01:19.030
I'm going to import a component that we don't have yet.

01:19.160 --> 01:28.510
That's called scroll from a file that will create in just the second as create a new file.

01:30.610 --> 01:32.040
We'll call that scroll.

01:32.080 --> 01:42.850
Yes J.S. and here will again go through the motion of re-act from re-act.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.340
Make this a little bit bigger.

01:46.150 --> 01:54.470
And again I want to change this to Babbo and we'll say Konst scroll.

01:54.610 --> 02:01.790
He calls it's going to return from what should have returned.

02:01.850 --> 02:11.790
Before we talk about that just so we don't forget we have to export default skirl.

02:11.800 --> 02:18.910
Now here's a problem we want to return something but it doesn't make sense does it.

02:19.060 --> 02:20.220
If I go to opt out.

02:20.320 --> 02:20.910
Yes.

02:22.130 --> 02:22.990
Scroll.

02:23.010 --> 02:27.850
It's not a self closing component it wraps components.

02:27.870 --> 02:33.420
So how can we tell scroll to hey just render whatever's inside of you

02:36.320 --> 02:37.370
up to this point.

02:37.430 --> 02:44.280
We've learned about props and we've learned about state.

02:44.340 --> 02:53.040
There's one or the thing and react that I want to teach you and that is children and children is this

02:54.320 --> 03:00.310
scrawl can use children as a way to render its children.

03:00.740 --> 03:01.790
What do I mean by that.

03:03.040 --> 03:09.710
Well in here every profs object has children.

03:09.800 --> 03:16.540
So if I go prop's thought children well let's see what happens.

03:16.660 --> 03:28.460
I save and go back everything's render but if I remove this and I just do and H-1

03:37.000 --> 03:44.910
I just get this you see Propst our children is exactly that.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.490
If I Konsole don't log props

03:53.520 --> 03:54.860
Let's open up the console.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.770
I see that I get an object.

03:57.780 --> 04:07.560
And even though I am pass any props to scroll automatically every single component in Bre-X has this

04:07.560 --> 04:18.050
property children and this children a kind of confusing here but has card list type cardless

04:22.440 --> 04:32.800
So using this Propst start children we can create components that wrap other components up to this point.

04:32.800 --> 04:39.820
We were only able to wrap these lower case components which are kind of like the ASTM tags.

04:39.820 --> 04:44.680
But every time we had a custom component with a capital letter that we built well we couldn't really

04:44.680 --> 04:46.000
wrap it.

04:46.020 --> 04:50.690
Now we can using this thought children.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.690
But here's the cool part.

04:52.910 --> 04:54.940
Using props to our children.

04:55.160 --> 05:07.180
Well I can create a scrollable component Let me show you how simply do def clothes that div and end

05:07.180 --> 05:16.150
here began curly brackets prop's dot children and all we need now is to add styles to this div I could

05:16.150 --> 05:22.630
create a scroll dot CSSA file and add a style so that scrollable but I want to show you another way

05:22.630 --> 05:24.230
which is using stuff.

05:24.550 --> 05:25.950
Just like an HMO.

05:26.170 --> 05:35.200
Using this style attribute an GSX I can add styles but using double curly brackets that is.

05:35.200 --> 05:43.210
This is a javascript expression and within this I'm returning an object and this object can have CSSA

05:43.240 --> 05:47.760
else such as a property overflow.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.030
Why.

05:50.040 --> 05:54.450
Which is a CSSA property and this you can say scroll.

05:54.480 --> 06:06.870
Again a CSSA way to make the element scrollable will save border is one pixel solid block and finally

06:06.870 --> 06:17.670
will give it a height of 500 pixels going to make the smaller so you can see I'm going to save compiling

06:17.670 --> 06:18.290
is fine.

06:18.330 --> 06:21.560
If I go back it looks like we have a box here.

06:21.690 --> 06:26.520
Let's make it a little bit bigger just so you can see and say 5 pixels even though it's ugly.

06:26.610 --> 06:30.150
And I forgot a 10 here right.

06:30.180 --> 06:36.760
All right let's see that we have a scrollable component.

06:36.770 --> 06:44.110
Let's make this a little bit bigger just so we can see a better look at that.

06:44.160 --> 06:53.650
If I make the smaller I now have a scrollbar component side of this.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.250
Very cool.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.690
Now this is a simple WAP.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.550
It allows you to search.

07:00.570 --> 07:07.440
It allows you to scroll but it does show the power of Riette doesn't it.

07:08.260 --> 07:18.050
We've created these simple functions and the only thing that we tell it to do is well we tell it what

07:18.050 --> 07:24.880
state it has the entire app is described through these two things.

07:25.040 --> 07:34.550
The robots and search field and re-act takes care of the rest as soon as search field or robot changes

07:35.330 --> 07:38.200
react trickles down.

07:38.200 --> 07:46.880
All this information as props to all these components and magically creates our view for us.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.780
That's why react is so powerful it's a view layer.

07:49.870 --> 07:55.580
It takes care of manipulating the DOM and all we tell it is hey what's the state.

07:55.780 --> 07:59.610
What are the functions that you wanted to work with the state and the rest.

07:59.620 --> 08:06.400
Well it optimizes to make sure that everything is super fast and you can see how amazingly fast everything

08:06.400 --> 08:06.870
is here.

08:06.880 --> 08:12.220
It's a super snappy app and these components are now reusable.

08:12.220 --> 08:19.570
I can bring search box now into a another part of the web site I can add scrolling to another part of

08:19.570 --> 08:20.440
the Web site.

08:21.240 --> 08:27.430
This is what made react so powerful and this is why so many Web sites are powered by re-act.

08:27.480 --> 08:35.960
Once you learn the syntax and you get used to everything that's when re-act truly becomes powerful.

08:35.960 --> 08:41.790
And although we took a bit of time to create the sap once you get used to it and applied this you can

08:41.790 --> 08:46.980
create it in what less than an hour probably 30 minutes.

08:47.050 --> 08:49.980
All right I think we've done a great job here.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.560
Can't wait to see you in the next video.
