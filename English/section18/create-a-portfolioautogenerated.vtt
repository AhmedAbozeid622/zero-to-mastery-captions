WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:02.710
All right everybody.

00:02.730 --> 00:10.060
We have a really exciting video here because we're gonna build our own portfolio page.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.160
That's right.

00:11.160 --> 00:18.530
We're going to build this so you can showcase your projects to your future employers.

00:18.530 --> 00:25.500
And just have a place to put your projects that we're going to work on throughout the course.

00:25.640 --> 00:31.180
Again to impress that special someone or your future employer.

00:31.210 --> 00:38.700
Now this is actually very cool because this page was built by a fellow student.

00:38.710 --> 00:45.130
This student actually finished the course and went on to create this project as a way to say thank you

00:45.130 --> 00:50.100
to the developer community that he received so much help from.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.840
And it's called simple folio.

00:52.840 --> 00:57.600
And we're going to use this project as our base for our portfolio.

00:57.600 --> 01:04.800
Now I'll link to this repository so you can follow along and you can customize your own portfolio.

01:04.840 --> 01:10.370
And as we go through the course you can actually add the projects as I'm about to show you.

01:10.480 --> 01:19.390
Now one thing I do want to say is that this project is M.I.T. licensed which means that you can use

01:19.390 --> 01:24.220
it freely for yourself and customize it to your liking.

01:24.220 --> 01:30.040
I'll show you how to do that but I do want to acknowledge the fact that this student put in a lot of

01:30.040 --> 01:33.060
effort to this and it's actually quite a nice project.

01:33.130 --> 01:42.490
So I do recommend if you have just point five seconds going to his project and clicking on the star

01:43.300 --> 01:46.120
to show some appreciation.

01:46.220 --> 01:47.360
All right enough talk.

01:47.420 --> 01:50.700
Let's actually build our portfolio.

01:50.780 --> 01:53.110
I'm going to clone this project.

01:53.240 --> 02:00.500
I'm going to use SS H but you might have to use HDP s depending on your GitHub setup so let's clone

02:00.530 --> 02:12.630
this repository I'll say get clone and clone these simple folio project all C.D. into simple folio and

02:12.630 --> 02:15.690
I'll open this and sublime.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.030
Now don't get intimidated by all these files.

02:19.030 --> 02:22.700
There may be things here that you haven't seen before.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.960
Again we'll cover most of these throughout the course.

02:26.260 --> 02:31.860
But luckily for you this project actually has a really nice getting started guy.

02:32.170 --> 02:34.280
So let's go step by step.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.020
We've cloned the repo.

02:37.150 --> 02:40.420
We've seeded into the repository.

02:40.420 --> 02:46.450
We can run this command if we want to remove the origin repository.

02:46.450 --> 02:52.180
That means if we had fought the project which by the way if you want.

02:52.210 --> 02:55.470
You probably might want to fork this project.

02:55.720 --> 03:01.750
In my case I just cloned it because while this is just for demonstration purposes but you can actually

03:01.870 --> 03:11.200
run this command to remove this original project so that you only have your own copy your own forked

03:11.260 --> 03:17.400
copy to worry about because most likely you won't do any pull requests to this original project.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.210
You can just have your own version.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.860
Next we run npm install.

03:23.130 --> 03:24.000
So let's do that.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.360
Let's say npm install.

03:26.530 --> 03:29.860
And while that's being installed Let's go next.

03:29.950 --> 03:36.060
And it says we just have to run NPM start and it gives us a couple of commands.

03:36.070 --> 03:42.820
If we have any issues but hopefully things go well we can just run NPM start.

03:42.820 --> 03:46.000
Let's clear this and say NPM start

03:50.650 --> 03:51.590
Hey look at that.

03:51.670 --> 03:54.060
There's the portfolio.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.110
Very very cool.

03:56.110 --> 04:00.960
Just like that we have our template for our portfolio.

04:01.130 --> 04:07.060
Now if we go back we'll see that we have template instructions here.

04:07.070 --> 04:09.530
So it actually tells us exactly what to add.

04:09.590 --> 04:12.910
And we have enough knowledge now to be able to understand this.

04:12.950 --> 04:13.710
Right.

04:13.760 --> 04:19.100
So it looks like we can change things in the template thought a shemale and change the hero section

04:19.160 --> 04:26.420
which is the main section with our hero title and hero CTA which means call to action.

04:26.840 --> 04:38.340
So let's do that let's go to the source folder into the templates that a shemale and then well we can

04:38.340 --> 04:40.790
change the title here to my name

04:44.170 --> 04:48.130
and then in the hero section right over here we'll change.

04:48.190 --> 04:52.220
Hi my name is to your own name.

04:55.220 --> 05:02.880
I'm the unknown developer let's call this the I'm the developer.

05:02.880 --> 05:09.410
You need an end the hero call to action instead of no more.

05:09.460 --> 05:12.030
We'll just say hire me.

05:12.190 --> 05:14.670
Sounds kind of desperate but it's fine.

05:14.670 --> 05:15.270
All right.

05:15.280 --> 05:19.990
So just by saving this it's going to detect the changes.

05:19.990 --> 05:23.200
And if I go to our project.

05:23.380 --> 05:24.310
Hey look at that.

05:24.310 --> 05:25.710
I have my name here.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.280
I'm the developer you need.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.060
And it says hire me.

05:29.060 --> 05:33.720
Awesome next stop is probably the About Me section.

05:34.580 --> 05:37.910
Let's go here in the About section.

05:37.910 --> 05:44.480
Once again there's a nice roomy so we can just replace our p tags with whatever descriptions we want

05:44.990 --> 05:49.570
and we can also change the image so that we have our image in here.

05:50.990 --> 06:00.090
Now in order to do that all we need to do is to change the profile picture in our assets folder so if

06:00.090 --> 06:07.040
I go to the assets folder I see that there is a profile PMG here that we just need to replace.

06:07.070 --> 06:14.600
Now if I open up the project here if I go to source the assets folder I actually already have my picture

06:14.600 --> 06:20.870
so I'm just going to paste this picture in I'm going to replace it with my own profile.

06:21.500 --> 06:30.160
So that now if we go back we have my giant face here and check that out.

06:30.180 --> 06:31.170
There you go.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.610
I have the About Me page.

06:32.610 --> 06:35.280
I can even attach my resumÃ© if I want.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.810
And now let's go to the projects section.

06:37.920 --> 06:42.470
When the project section is quite nice so we can attach source code.

06:42.480 --> 06:47.720
We can see live so we can maybe attach a github page link here.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.390
Our own Web site.

06:49.560 --> 06:55.440
So let's say throughout the course we build projects and you want to showcase your projects.

06:55.500 --> 07:00.520
So we have the background generator project that we've created already.

07:00.600 --> 07:07.250
But let's say in an upcoming section in the react section we're building a project called robo friends.

07:07.410 --> 07:14.900
So let's say we just created the robo friends project which is right over here and this is something

07:14.900 --> 07:20.870
that I'll link to when we finish that section and we'll have this exact setup and let's say we want

07:20.870 --> 07:23.410
to showcase this project on our portfolio.

07:23.420 --> 07:30.940
Well if we go to the instructions once again we have a great step by step guide of what to change.

07:31.010 --> 07:34.310
So we just need to go to the project wrapper section.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.050
So once again go to our template.

07:37.310 --> 07:45.150
Scroll down past the about section into the project section and here.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.670
Each row is a project.

07:47.670 --> 07:50.890
So let's make this a little bit bigger.

07:50.910 --> 07:56.740
We have the project title which will replace this with robo friends.

07:56.800 --> 08:06.200
We don't have to change the scripture right now and then we can link to the live version which in my

08:06.200 --> 08:08.900
case it's right over here.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.830
Again I'll show you how to do this.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.280
During the react section of the course.

08:14.470 --> 08:18.810
But I can just change this to a trip like this.

08:19.590 --> 08:30.640
And the source code will just be this repository so once again copy and paste like that now.

08:30.660 --> 08:36.270
The last thing we need is to have an image of our project.

08:36.270 --> 08:43.250
Now I want to show you a really cool resource which is this logo maker and I'll link to this resource.

08:43.270 --> 08:47.400
It's called Hatfill and we can actually create logos for free.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.920
So let's just click get started.

08:49.930 --> 08:57.550
We'll build a tech logo but you can pick whatever you want and let's say we want an innovative logo.

08:57.550 --> 08:57.850
All right.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.860
Let's click next.

09:00.270 --> 09:05.490
And I've done this before so we can call our project robo friends.

09:05.490 --> 09:08.480
Let's do a capital are actually no let's leave it like that.

09:08.610 --> 09:12.190
And the slogan that I chose is the only friends you need.

09:12.210 --> 09:19.160
So if I click Next year let's say what the logo before it'll be for an online store or a Web site click.

09:19.230 --> 09:21.660
Next hand check this out.

09:22.020 --> 09:26.960
It's going to generate some logos for us and they all look pretty cool right.

09:26.970 --> 09:33.510
Let's see which one I like best we can pick whichever one I like this one so let's do robo friends over

09:33.510 --> 09:41.310
here I can include that slogan if I want but let's just click through next and you can download the

09:41.310 --> 09:42.180
logo.

09:42.330 --> 09:50.070
Now in order to download and get the logo for different things like Facebook profile image Instagram

09:50.070 --> 09:53.610
profile image you'll have to create an account.

09:53.640 --> 09:57.630
But again it's free so you can still use it.

09:57.930 --> 10:02.870
In my case I already create an account and I have this image downloaded.

10:02.970 --> 10:08.730
So all I'm going to do is replace again in this same assets folder as before.

10:08.730 --> 10:18.470
Replace the banner with my own banner which is the logo that we downloaded.

10:18.480 --> 10:24.580
So again if I go back to the project everything should be working.

10:24.660 --> 10:27.290
Let's go to our portfolio.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.070
Hey.

10:28.090 --> 10:29.020
Look at that.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.730
That is awesome.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.460
There is my project.

10:32.560 --> 10:36.450
If I go to see live there's my robo friends project.

10:36.460 --> 10:42.770
Again something that will build together so I can search all my friends and I can even go to the source

10:42.770 --> 10:51.450
code of my getup profile page and notice here that the projects all have the same image now.

10:51.780 --> 10:57.340
That's because in the code all the images point to banner dot PMG.

10:57.420 --> 11:03.060
But as you can imagine by just changing the name to different logos you'll be able to have multiple

11:03.060 --> 11:06.090
projects on your profile.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.920
How cool is that.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.860
And you can have different things like call to action.

11:10.860 --> 11:17.250
Again we've looked at getting an e-mail subscribed form if you want it you can link to your get high

11:17.250 --> 11:19.170
profile your Twitter account

11:23.290 --> 11:28.520
and we have a pretty nice project just in a couple of minutes.

11:28.530 --> 11:29.850
How cool is that.

11:29.930 --> 11:36.300
Now if we go to the documentation you'll have different things like the contact section.

11:36.310 --> 11:43.180
They can update the photo section that you can update but the last thing I want to do is this stylus

11:43.450 --> 11:50.650
that is you can adjust the styles of this project by going to these styles abstract and variable dot

11:50.920 --> 11:52.790
SC as s.

11:52.930 --> 11:57.270
This is actually a file format for what we call SAS.

11:57.370 --> 12:04.950
It's kind of like C Ss but it gives you extra features so let me show you what I mean.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.780
You see here that I can change the default colors so if I click on this link that this document provides

12:12.350 --> 12:21.490
it gives us couple of UI gradients that we can use so I can actually just copy this and you might see

12:21.520 --> 12:25.230
that this is quite familiar to what we had before with our background project.

12:25.810 --> 12:31.770
But if I copy this go back to the documentation and change the default values.

12:32.050 --> 12:40.810
So that is if we go to the styles the abstract and then the variables we can change the primary color

12:40.840 --> 12:43.570
and the secondary color of the gradient.

12:43.570 --> 12:52.000
So let's just copy what we just copied from that gradient Web site and this is where the SAS files come

12:52.000 --> 12:52.990
in handy.

12:52.990 --> 12:59.760
You see with SAS files so you can do something called variables like this using the dollar sign notation.

12:59.950 --> 13:07.090
And now any time in the SAS file when you use the word primary color it's going to be replaced with

13:07.180 --> 13:09.000
the actual color.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.570
So it's just extra little boost that you get with CSX.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.820
Again something that we don't need to worry about.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.660
All you need to know is that you can change the colors over here.

13:19.870 --> 13:28.320
If I now save and go back to my portfolio a look at that and the colors are all different.

13:28.370 --> 13:36.450
I get that blue color still get that nice gradient and I've made this portfolio even more personal to

13:36.450 --> 13:40.150
me now I'll leave the rest up to you.

13:40.210 --> 13:44.850
This is just a way for you to get started and keep track of your projects as you go through the course.

13:45.820 --> 13:52.360
And on top of that there is also a step by step tutorial for deployment so you can actually deploy this

13:52.360 --> 14:00.220
project to production using something called net Fi and make it really really easy to share your project

14:00.460 --> 14:05.370
outside of just on your local host again.

14:05.380 --> 14:08.740
That is something for you to explore and do on your own.

14:09.070 --> 14:19.200
But for now if you have a nice starter template of your project pretty awesome right now the last thing

14:19.230 --> 14:25.080
you should do is once again thank the student for the work that they've put in with simple folio by

14:25.110 --> 14:28.410
giving it a star for the repository.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.470
And once you're done.

14:30.720 --> 14:39.150
Go to our Dischord channel and if we go to look what I made channel you can share your portfolio with

14:39.150 --> 14:45.870
others or you can think the student that actually created this which has this handle.

14:45.870 --> 14:50.970
So let's just say thanks for the simple folio.

14:50.970 --> 14:58.350
We're recording right now and using your project pretty

15:02.360 --> 15:07.770
area your own little portfolio project to get you started.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.520
I'll see in the next one by.
