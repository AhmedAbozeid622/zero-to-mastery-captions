OK are robo friends app is starting to look good it does some searching which is great.

00:07.330 --> 00:08.860
It's very interactive.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.300
But let's have some style so just sort of looks like this.

00:12.430 --> 00:15.820
And I mean Stiles is something that we've already covered.

00:15.820 --> 00:18.330
I just want to get you up and running quickly.

00:18.590 --> 00:24.850
Let's start off with first the background as you can see we can just generate a gradient and have that

00:24.850 --> 00:25.980
background.

00:26.230 --> 00:30.460
I've already found a really good background too greedy and that we can use.

00:30.820 --> 00:35.380
You can use the background generator that we've actually already created in previous videos.

00:35.380 --> 00:43.480
For now as you know if we want to change the CSSA of our entire app Well we have indexed CSSA which

00:43.480 --> 00:45.040
is perfect for this.

00:45.040 --> 00:53.510
And then we can just put in the gradient that we want going to save this and look at that.

00:53.630 --> 01:00.820
It tells us that there is an update and gradient has outdated directions syntax new syntax is like two

01:00.830 --> 01:02.610
left instead of right.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.670
Well isn't that convenient.

01:05.770 --> 01:08.040
Let's do that to left.

01:08.210 --> 01:09.780
Let's see if that still works.

01:11.590 --> 01:13.880
OK everything's looking nice.

01:13.890 --> 01:14.570
Perfect.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.690
Let's fix our font.

01:16.860 --> 01:19.380
Now if you see over here we have this cool font.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.880
How did I get that.

01:20.910 --> 01:29.000
Actually I just googled for the Sega Logo font and I found this web site that has free fonts you can

01:29.000 --> 01:34.440
use and we can actually just click on generate font face what font.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.510
And there's something that you don't really need to know.

01:36.780 --> 01:39.630
It's just a matter of googling finding the font that you want.

01:39.930 --> 01:48.910
But if you download this file you'll see that it actually has c w o f which is actually a font file

01:49.510 --> 01:59.240
and styles Azzi SS So it actually tells you why you can include let's copy that added to our head or

01:59.240 --> 02:04.280
one which if you look over here lives in Daut.

02:04.490 --> 02:05.980
J Yes.

02:06.260 --> 02:12.170
Using app Duchessa which I think we've deleted that already so let's bring it back by adding a new file

02:12.280 --> 02:14.520
app dot see.

02:14.990 --> 02:22.070
So we'll just copy and paste what we did and font face just tells us our font and in order to use that

02:22.130 --> 02:37.280
we'll just say H-1 has font family of Sega Logo font.

02:37.330 --> 02:42.670
Now this don't actually do anything because well we need the font file so they can find Sega Logo font

02:45.410 --> 02:50.030
and that's simply a matter of us dragging in our font file.

02:50.080 --> 02:55.310
Let's minimize this into our robo friends.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.290
And let's see now.

02:58.370 --> 03:00.200
It should be right over here.

03:01.100 --> 03:07.400
And we can simply access it by looking at the you are all.

03:07.610 --> 03:13.900
If our app dot CSSA file has access to this font we can just move it

03:19.130 --> 03:26.580
into our source folder.

03:26.670 --> 03:27.060
All right.

03:27.100 --> 03:32.980
And one thing you might notice is that while nothing will change because in order for this CSSA file

03:32.980 --> 03:40.000
to work we have to import it to always remember import apt.

03:40.290 --> 03:42.830
C Ss save it.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.030
Compiling.

03:45.210 --> 03:45.930
All right.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.810
I don't know if you can see it but it's there.

03:49.030 --> 03:53.300
So we want to make it bigger and obviously the color block doesn't work well with this background.

03:55.130 --> 03:58.700
Again this part is an CSSA song going to go through this quickly.

03:58.700 --> 04:03.620
I have a few styles here font weight and a color that is nice.

04:03.620 --> 04:13.410
Make sure that we have it import it and using Tankian we can just make this bigger we can just say class

04:13.740 --> 04:16.640
name he calls.

04:16.820 --> 04:19.460
He can do f one to lose to have two

04:22.750 --> 04:26.570
Swan All right.

04:26.590 --> 04:27.660
That looks pretty good.

04:29.080 --> 04:33.400
Our app is looking nice and clean.

04:33.400 --> 04:39.540
There's still a few changes that we want to make but overall everything looks good.

04:39.560 --> 04:46.130
We've played around a bit with the CSSA we've added a new font file and we've changed a background of

04:46.370 --> 04:53.120
index thought JS file with the index dot CSSA.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.390
All right we're going to get back to learning more react in the next video.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.530
I'll see on that one.

04:58.580 --> 04:58.870
Bye bye.
