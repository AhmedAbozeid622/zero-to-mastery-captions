WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:04.900
It let's build our robo friends app I think to get started.

00:04.930 --> 00:10.730
We want to think about component's again and what kind of components we want to build.

00:10.750 --> 00:16.720
Looking at this Web site the smallest component that we've probably want to start working on is perhaps

00:17.020 --> 00:19.000
the cart component.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.480
This cart over here if we can build one of these then according to what I've said before we can just

00:25.720 --> 00:29.180
copy all these components and add them to the page.

00:29.350 --> 00:31.440
So let's start off with this.

00:31.660 --> 00:34.530
The card component.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.400
All right.

00:36.580 --> 00:40.610
Now we won't be using the halo component anymore.

00:40.690 --> 00:43.430
And if you remember it looked like this.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.530
Let's just I know it's sad but we're going to delete it.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.810
Delete the hello C Ss.

00:50.290 --> 00:52.090
Start off clean.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.830
So Song going to delete OK.

01:00.330 --> 01:03.810
And we'll also delete hollowed out CSX.

01:03.850 --> 01:09.040
I know all our hard work just completely gone.

01:09.210 --> 01:12.420
You know we're going to start cleaning things that we don't need.

01:12.420 --> 01:16.880
And this project for example the app dodgiest that we had initially.

01:16.890 --> 01:23.200
Well we can delete that can also delete Abkhazia SS

01:27.400 --> 01:28.450
Avodart test

01:32.370 --> 01:41.020
and the logo.

01:41.050 --> 01:41.500
All right.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.410
So everything's looking very small now.

01:44.470 --> 01:52.430
We have just and ex-Nazi SS and Exidy ass and this register a service worker that comes in with Korea

01:52.430 --> 01:54.620
react up that we don't need to touch.

01:54.950 --> 02:00.940
OK obviously we have failed to compile because Walder Hello imports doesn't really work we don't have

02:00.940 --> 02:03.970
anything so let's start off with this.

02:03.990 --> 02:08.670
Let's start off by creating a card component.

02:10.330 --> 02:15.870
And this car component will have to import it from card thought.

02:15.940 --> 02:22.860
J.S. again if I save this still get an error because it doesn't exist.

02:22.990 --> 02:23.740
So let's create it.

02:23.770 --> 02:37.130
I'm going to say new file Kardon just then making sure that this is using Bayville and let's do what

02:37.130 --> 02:38.870
we've done before we do import

02:42.180 --> 02:46.800
re-act from re-act.

02:47.050 --> 02:51.520
Instead of doing the CLOs way for now we're just going to worry about building the function.

02:51.580 --> 02:57.440
So I'm going to say Konst card equals.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.400
It won't have any properties for now.

03:00.470 --> 03:05.490
And this will return costs in brackets.

03:11.530 --> 03:21.110
And within here it will say that it has a div within this div will have an image and this image will

03:21.110 --> 03:26.180
have some sort of a source that we don't know what it is yet so we'll just keep it the way it is.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.840
Closing tag and we'll have another div

03:34.780 --> 03:35.500
within here.

03:35.520 --> 03:46.980
If you remember we have our name and email in here so we'll just do an H-2 we'll just write hardcoded

03:46.990 --> 03:48.080
values here.

03:48.310 --> 03:51.890
Well Jane Jane Doe.

03:52.070 --> 04:01.090
And finally a pizza that has some e-mail address this to Jane Doe at gmail dot com.

04:01.550 --> 04:03.620
Close the tag.

04:03.670 --> 04:03.970
All right.

04:03.970 --> 04:07.530
So we just have a simple component that's returning.

04:07.540 --> 04:08.060
Card.

04:08.110 --> 04:10.950
And remember we want to export this.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.530
So we want to say export default card

04:17.370 --> 04:18.210
save.

04:18.490 --> 04:21.480
I get I'm Gilman's must have an alt property.

04:21.630 --> 04:23.390
Again it's giving me a nice hand.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.920
So let's just add a cult property.

04:26.970 --> 04:29.540
We just say what this photo is.

04:29.640 --> 04:38.870
So I'll just say photo for now or I'll say robots for now compile successfully if we look back at our

04:38.870 --> 04:46.130
app we have robots Jane Doe and Jane Doe perfect.

04:46.160 --> 04:52.850
All right we have the card component and you must be asking yourself why are we using re-act here if

04:52.850 --> 04:54.630
we're not really using it.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.510
Let's see what happens if I remove it.

04:58.130 --> 05:05.370
I get a whole bunch of errors says re-act must be in scope when using GSX remember.

05:05.390 --> 05:07.810
GSX is this.

05:07.910 --> 05:16.680
We're not writing a shemale we're writing GSX and we need to import react so that our program understands

05:16.740 --> 05:20.070
GSX this a symbol like syntax.

05:20.300 --> 05:26.470
OK now we need an image and for this exercise I have something called Roble hash for you.

05:26.820 --> 05:29.100
It's a really really cool API.

05:29.100 --> 05:33.240
And for those that don't know what API is or don't worry you have a session coming up with all that

05:33.240 --> 05:35.350
information well you'll get to learn about it.

05:35.550 --> 05:45.180
But the cool thing about roba hashes I can just say anything in here and it will return very random

05:45.180 --> 05:47.420
robot for me.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.530
All we need is just this.

05:49.740 --> 05:59.130
You are el and I can just say for now test.

05:59.370 --> 06:05.840
If I save this and go back to my example.

06:06.020 --> 06:06.610
There you go.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.150
We have our Random robot.

06:08.450 --> 06:17.760
If I changed this to let's say test test I save Well now I get another robot.

06:17.780 --> 06:18.820
How cool is that.

06:20.500 --> 06:27.610
All right I want to make sure that the size is somewhat small so you can do a question mark here and

06:27.610 --> 06:29.120
just give it width and height.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.830
So I'm just going to do 200 by 200.

06:32.890 --> 06:36.150
And again this is just something that you do with this.

06:36.310 --> 06:40.950
You are all that they give you and the information here how will make you go through it.

06:44.940 --> 06:47.520
Everything should look nice.

06:49.020 --> 07:00.330
Now let's say I wanted to add a title and I'll do something like divx or H-1 robo friends here.

07:06.950 --> 07:08.240
You see I get an error here.

07:08.390 --> 07:17.430
It's because remember we need to return one thing and we can have multiple elements being returned right.

07:17.610 --> 07:21.540
If we want to return something make sure it's one thing or an array.

07:21.540 --> 07:25.520
But for now we'll worry about the title later.

07:25.530 --> 07:29.640
We want to make sure that we're only returning one element.

07:29.640 --> 07:35.680
So in this case that div element that has a ton of things inside which is the card component.

07:35.690 --> 07:38.930
All right let's save.

07:38.960 --> 07:39.230
All right.

07:39.260 --> 07:41.720
We have our card component.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.760
It looks nice but what if I wanted to have multiple cars.

07:45.760 --> 07:50.350
Now according to what we know because we have the card component.

07:50.360 --> 08:00.810
If I go to index start yes I can just say I've put this on our new line so you can see I can just wrap

08:00.810 --> 08:09.080
this in a div again because we want to return just a single element and I could say Card

08:12.090 --> 08:16.040
card and close the DIV tag

08:18.650 --> 08:22.660
save and look at that we have multiple cards.

08:22.650 --> 08:26.350
Now they're each their own component.

08:26.540 --> 08:32.420
But let's have some styling to this just to make it look nicer again because we have Takio.

08:32.750 --> 08:39.290
We can use some really nice syntax if we go to the current component within the div I can say class

08:39.440 --> 08:40.310
name again.

08:40.340 --> 08:45.180
Remember we can't use class B.G. light green.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.780
So that is background light green and this is just tacky on classes that are already predefined for

08:50.780 --> 08:51.840
us again.

08:52.060 --> 08:54.870
CSSA section this isn't that.

08:54.950 --> 09:00.260
So we're not going to focus too much on CSSA I'll just give you the styling say you need we have the

09:00.260 --> 09:07.570
div the border we have padding of three lots of margins too as well.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.060
And then it will do grow which is the animation.

09:10.070 --> 09:16.510
So if I save this look at that and that's that's pretty nice.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.670
You know it looks at a few more will do.

09:21.820 --> 09:29.560
BW too and shadow 5 to add a bit of shadows to them.

09:30.010 --> 09:30.600
There you go.

09:30.630 --> 09:32.740
It looks more 3D now.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.900
That looks very nice.

09:35.200 --> 09:35.530
There you go.

09:35.530 --> 09:37.400
We have our cards again.

09:37.420 --> 09:43.840
We don't want this static card where it says Jane Doe Jane Doe Jane Doe we want it to be dynamic.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.100
Right.

09:44.100 --> 09:53.040
So it sounds like we need what we call prop's properties well and actually have for you a robot's object

09:53.040 --> 09:53.920
that I've created.

09:54.030 --> 10:01.140
So I'm just going to add a new file here that says robots dodgy us and within here I'm just going to

10:01.140 --> 10:08.910
copy and paste this as you can see it is just a constant object it's robots it's an array of objects

10:08.910 --> 10:16.420
and it has ID name user name email and these are just random that I've made.

10:16.530 --> 10:21.440
If you want this file then you can grab the files from the end of this section.

10:21.610 --> 10:26.300
But for now this way I have something that I can use and you can see I'm exporting it.

10:26.410 --> 10:36.140
I can say import robots from Dot because we're in the same directory.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.000
Robots.

10:39.060 --> 10:48.760
Now if I save this we got robots as defined by never used but because this is using export instead of

10:48.790 --> 10:52.630
export default this file could have multiple exports.

10:52.690 --> 10:54.620
It just so happens that I only have one.

10:54.880 --> 11:01.960
The rule is for these phones because there are a default Well you can just to cart for ones that aren't

11:01.960 --> 11:02.650
default.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.530
You have to restructure it.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.020
That is like this.

11:07.030 --> 11:14.930
So that if I have another variable let's say that says Katz then I will have to do that to grab it.

11:16.220 --> 11:21.930
So we have robots and now I can't give it some properties.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.340
I can say ID equals.

11:24.370 --> 11:33.130
And again we have these brackets so that it's a javascript expression and we'll say robots but robots

11:34.570 --> 11:44.070
first array thought id has the ID then we have name equals robots.

11:44.150 --> 11:58.340
Again the first user thought name close to bracket and then we also have email he calls robots first

11:58.340 --> 12:03.400
and the array got email.

12:03.440 --> 12:10.140
Holy moly that's a lot of typing and I'm going to make this smaller just so you can see I'm going to

12:10.140 --> 12:15.580
copy and paste for the other ones as well except for.

12:15.660 --> 12:23.150
Change this to the second user and then the third use.

12:23.220 --> 12:31.560
Hope the second user.

12:31.800 --> 12:39.750
Now if I save this it's compiled successfully but nothing has changed because we need to go to cards

12:39.810 --> 12:47.070
and a close robust dodgiest for now this because cards it needs to now accept parameters and what are

12:47.070 --> 12:47.810
the parameters.

12:47.820 --> 13:05.620
Well it's properties and these props are now props Daut name and props dot.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.650
I save that go back.

13:08.840 --> 13:13.340
It's not working well because this is a javascript expression.

13:13.400 --> 13:13.950
Right.

13:13.970 --> 13:18.050
So I need to wrap it in curly brackets.

13:18.820 --> 13:22.870
Just the way it works in GSX save.

13:23.020 --> 13:23.680
Look at that.

13:23.750 --> 13:29.840
We have dynamic names that we're passing as properties to each one.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.950
Let's add tech center here.

13:33.800 --> 13:34.630
And there you go.

13:34.670 --> 13:35.890
Now we have everything Center.

13:35.960 --> 13:36.800
That's a lot better.

13:38.260 --> 13:38.490
OK.

13:38.500 --> 13:42.210
But we also passed ID we can use ID to do something cool.

13:42.250 --> 13:50.500
If you remember in that ESX section we have template strings and because this is a template string we

13:50.500 --> 13:55.020
have to wrap it in a curly bracket so it's a javascript expression.

13:55.360 --> 14:02.780
And now within the robo hash instead of using test here we can randomize what robots we get.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.310
Using the syntax as you remember.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.790
And in here we can just say prop's dot ID.

14:08.920 --> 14:16.000
So now this will say Roble hashed out org ID of whatever it is for the robot with the site.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.200
So we make sure that again the IDs are always dynamic and changing.

14:20.200 --> 14:29.010
If I save this and go back look at that you see that there's a bit of a delay again because we're talking

14:29.010 --> 14:31.440
to the API and the API is returning.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.800
Answer for us but how cool is that.

14:33.810 --> 14:39.350
We just created our own dynamic cartes.

14:39.380 --> 14:46.120
One last thing although this works something nicer that you can do is we have something called destructuring.

14:46.370 --> 14:48.500
We can do something like Konst

14:50.940 --> 14:57.730
name email equals prop's again.

14:57.820 --> 15:05.470
As you may remember from E6 and now I can use outside ideas well

15:11.280 --> 15:12.430
and it still works.

15:14.240 --> 15:21.160
Another cool thing that you can do and this is even cleaner is within the parameters you can do destructuring.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.840
Again you can add this over here now.

15:28.740 --> 15:34.790
And now if I save it should still work and it does.

15:34.990 --> 15:42.070
This might be confusing if you're new to destructuring But as you saw step by step we're just receiving

15:42.070 --> 15:46.260
props and we're destructuring the props right inside of the brackets here.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.440
This is much cleaner.

15:50.760 --> 15:51.450
All right.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.210
That was a lot of fun in a really really fast way.

15:54.210 --> 15:57.960
We've just created our own cards in the next section.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.120
We're going to expand on this and make this even better.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.820
I'll see that one but by.
