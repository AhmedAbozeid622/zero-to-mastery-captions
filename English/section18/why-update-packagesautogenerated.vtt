WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:02.520
Welcome back.

00:02.590 --> 00:10.180
Now we're going to get started on react and learning react in building a project around react in the

00:10.180 --> 00:11.920
upcoming videos.

00:11.920 --> 00:18.820
But I do want to mention one thing that is at the end of the videos we're going to build a project a

00:18.820 --> 00:23.940
robo France project and we're gonna put it up on github.

00:24.060 --> 00:30.270
Now you don't need to worry about all the files that are in here but you will notice that there's a

00:30.270 --> 00:35.620
package that Jason File in this package that Jason File.

00:35.620 --> 00:45.360
We've seen before has some dependencies with some versions of libraries and tools that we use.

00:45.580 --> 00:48.410
And we've talked about this before right.

00:48.430 --> 00:52.710
This is what NPM allows us to use to use this package.

00:52.730 --> 01:00.490
Dad Jason from but I want you to pay attention because when you start doing the project and we install

01:00.580 --> 01:03.970
react your versions are going to be different.

01:04.000 --> 01:13.180
For example the version we're using for react is sixteen point two which is actually outdated because

01:13.390 --> 01:20.350
a library is constantly evolving new fixes are being made new features are being added new security

01:20.350 --> 01:23.050
issues are being solved or fixed.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.380
So this number is constantly increasing.

01:26.420 --> 01:33.680
Now when you watch the videos and you follow along you'll have the latest version of react and your

01:33.680 --> 01:35.350
projects are going to work.

01:35.390 --> 01:36.380
No problem.

01:36.560 --> 01:43.430
But at the end of that section when we built everything I'm actually going to go back and upgrade and

01:43.430 --> 01:49.920
show you how I would do an upgrade so that we keep our projects as up to date as possible.

01:49.970 --> 01:57.340
Now why would we care about that well if I go to my robo friends project which I'll link to when we

01:57.340 --> 02:01.980
finish our ReACT project if we go to security here

02:05.250 --> 02:13.850
you'll see that I have zero opened alerts but there's 24 closed ones that actually closed myself and

02:13.860 --> 02:19.800
if I scroll through it shows me how many security issues I have in this project.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.260
You see one of them is high severity.

02:22.260 --> 02:24.570
One is critical severity.

02:24.570 --> 02:26.210
That's not good right.

02:26.250 --> 02:33.780
And sometimes when you look through get hub repositories you might see a warning like this Hey we found

02:33.780 --> 02:39.460
some potential security vulnerabilities in your dependencies that is in my package.

02:39.510 --> 02:48.270
Got Jason File I have some libraries that I've downloaded or that I'm using in my project that are now

02:48.360 --> 02:54.400
outdated that I should upgrade because there's been some security updates.

02:54.500 --> 03:04.380
Now if I click on something like handlebars you'll see that we need to upgrade handlebars to this version

03:04.410 --> 03:05.490
or later.

03:05.820 --> 03:16.250
So essentially updated like this to fix an issue now get hub is nice enough to actually do automated

03:16.340 --> 03:17.370
security fixes.

03:17.390 --> 03:23.540
So if I click on this they'll actually make a pull request to my project to update these things.

03:24.210 --> 03:29.580
But we're going to say that until the end of the project so that you can actually see how the project

03:29.610 --> 03:36.780
is set up and how we can keep projects up to date and also secure so don't worry.

03:36.780 --> 03:39.890
If this lesson is a little confusing we're gonna come back to it.

03:39.900 --> 03:47.160
I just want to prepare you that when we build our project with react we're going to be up creating a

03:47.160 --> 03:53.880
bunch of the things later on at the end of the project just to show you that process now the last thing

03:53.880 --> 04:00.990
I want to mention is this idea of the center which we talked about which is the versions of packages

04:01.680 --> 04:06.360
you see over here that I have the load Rush package and I'll link to this resource that you can play

04:06.360 --> 04:06.930
around with.

04:07.620 --> 04:13.720
Let's say I wanted to download handlebars like we see over here.

04:13.890 --> 04:16.800
So if I wanted to checkout handle bars

04:20.190 --> 04:25.020
I see the handlebars package all the versions that it has now.

04:25.110 --> 04:32.700
If I go to the handlebars vulnerability it tells me that I should upgrade handlebars to this version

04:32.730 --> 04:37.400
or later because there's some security issues with the older version.

04:37.490 --> 04:39.920
Well I can just copy this.

04:39.920 --> 04:48.350
This version and if I go over here and enter the range it shows me exactly which packages I should be

04:48.350 --> 04:51.930
downloading or have an handlebars.

04:51.940 --> 04:55.600
Now you see here that I have different symbols that we haven't seen before.

04:55.750 --> 05:01.540
And if I go down it actually tells me that it specifies a range of stable versions.

05:01.600 --> 05:10.960
So this just means hey download anything greater or equal to Version 4.0 point for PD if I do the cart

05:11.230 --> 05:18.630
symbol which we've seen before and I hit enter I get the same thing but if I change this to let's say

05:18.630 --> 05:28.380
version 1 I see that with the carrot I get all the versions that are within version 1 but if I change

05:28.380 --> 05:34.880
this to greater than or equal to you see that I get versions 1 and above.

05:35.700 --> 05:40.680
So I'll leave this resource for you to explore again it's something we don't have to worry about too

05:40.680 --> 05:41.810
much right now.

05:42.030 --> 05:47.520
But I want to prepare you to start thinking about these things because when I first got it started nobody

05:47.520 --> 05:50.520
told me about this idea of updating packages.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.740
How do you update them.

05:51.750 --> 05:57.970
Why do we update them but this is a good practice that we will encounter.

05:58.110 --> 05:59.520
I'll see in the next one.

05:59.810 --> 06:00.090
Bobby.
