00:01.250 --> 00:07.580
Good job making it this far things are going to get more and more fun starting in this section because

00:07.820 --> 00:15.530
we're now learning real tools that real companies use and that will get you hired and development

00:15.560 --> 00:23.540
also becomes a lot faster because we're using these tools to make us build websites faster and better.

00:23.540 --> 00:28.770
So let's talk about react. What do we have before react?

00:28.870 --> 00:36.890
Well as I've mentioned before we had jQuery. jQuery was as you remember very imperative writing

00:36.890 --> 00:41.270
code was like mixing ingredients sequentially.

00:41.270 --> 00:44.480
If this happens then do this and then do that.

00:44.480 --> 00:50.070
But also if this happens then do this and it created a lot of inconsistencies.

00:50.300 --> 00:58.430
And if you remember the DOM manipulation section Well that is really really difficult and constantly keeping

00:58.430 --> 01:06.280
track of what changed and what to change is a huge mess and it creates for a very slow development.

01:06.740 --> 01:12.830
And as your website gets more and more complex it becomes very very hard to scale which means it becomes

01:12.830 --> 01:16.360
very hard for teams of developers to manage it.

01:17.450 --> 01:24.050
Now react was created at Facebook as you know Facebook is a pretty big app and a lot of things need

01:24.050 --> 01:25.670
to happen for it to work well.

01:25.820 --> 01:33.230
And they had this problem and they created react as a way to solve this issue and be able to have a tool

01:33.290 --> 01:39.410
that allows them to build websites in a nice predictable way that you can have multiple developers working

01:39.410 --> 01:40.630
on it at the same time.

01:42.410 --> 01:49.130
And I like to use the analogy of a bread machine using react is kind of like that you just throw in

01:49.130 --> 01:58.980
the ingredients and react does all this magic underneath the hood and puts out a website.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.670
So it's very reliable and very consistent.

02:02.500 --> 02:11.680
And it does one thing really really well and that is the view it manages to make our websites the DOM

02:12.810 --> 02:18.520
change in predictable ways that is easy to scale and easy to manage.

02:18.660 --> 02:24.690
And the beauty of react is that because it's just the view it doesn't necessarily mean it's only for

02:24.690 --> 02:25.710
browsers.

02:26.010 --> 02:32.200
As a matter of fact a react can be used with mobile devices to build native apps.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.760
It's used in virtual reality apps.

02:35.010 --> 02:41.310
You can build desktop apps with react anywhere that has a view well react can use it.

02:41.340 --> 02:48.450
And big companies as I mentioned before Facebook and Instagram use react and Netflix uses react whenever

02:48.450 --> 02:52.750
you browse through movie choices well that's using react underneath the hood.

02:53.040 --> 02:57.140
It's a very very useful tool and in very high demand.

02:57.210 --> 03:03.300
So I'm excited to talk about react and teach you this valuable skill in this section.

03:03.360 --> 03:09.390
Now in order to understand react there's a few things that we want to go over and these are principles

03:09.390 --> 03:14.850
that are very valuable that have been learned over the years by developers.

03:14.850 --> 03:21.360
One is the idea of thinking in components up to this point we've just built websites.

03:21.620 --> 03:27.250
Everything is just one JavaScript file one CSS file one HTML file.

03:27.380 --> 03:34.360
But wouldn't it be nice if the web was a network of these small components.

03:34.370 --> 03:41.180
Think of them as Lego blocks where everybody builds a specific Lego block and you just combine these

03:41.180 --> 03:44.600
Lego blocks to create your website.

03:44.810 --> 03:50.780
That is the idea that react established let's use this as an example.

03:50.900 --> 04:00.800
You first have atoms which as you can see here are icons and little small indivisible elements on

04:00.800 --> 04:03.350
your website such as images.

04:03.500 --> 04:07.780
There's some text and you divide these into atoms.

04:07.790 --> 04:16.040
From there you form molecules or combine atoms that have similar functionality such as the navigation

04:16.040 --> 04:17.090
bar down here.

04:17.090 --> 04:25.270
You combine individual atoms to add some functionality and then you have organisms again a little bit

04:25.270 --> 04:29.470
bigger than molecules that combines to a bigger scale functionality.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.530
And then finally you have templates.

04:31.840 --> 04:37.950
The combination of these organisms to give you an idea of how your app or website should look.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.580
Finally you have your pages.

04:39.640 --> 04:43.140
That is the page of your app.

04:43.350 --> 04:52.650
And if you think in components as this image demonstrates well you're able to build small little components

04:53.190 --> 04:58.200
that you can reuse and put on different parts of the webpage.

04:58.260 --> 05:05.550
For example this back-button here if I build a react component that is the back-button I can now use it on

05:05.670 --> 05:06.600
multiple pages.

05:06.600 --> 05:13.110
And I don't have to rewrite the code if I wanted the navigation bar to be used in different areas of

05:13.110 --> 05:13.590
the app.

05:13.590 --> 05:19.670
Well again I don't need to rewrite the code I write it once and I can reuse it as a matter of fact I can even

05:19.710 --> 05:21.020
share it with the world.

05:21.300 --> 05:28.900
And this idea of components makes react AMAZING because right here I have a website that has react

05:28.920 --> 05:32.280
components built by somebody and we can reuse these.

05:32.490 --> 05:36.290
And it's not just CSS and HTML.

05:36.330 --> 05:42.310
But real functionality such as navigation bars and sign-in forms.

05:42.320 --> 05:51.480
I can just download this react component and attach it to my website and because of the way react is

05:51.480 --> 05:56.690
structured it doesn't really need to know about the rest of the webpage it's just its own lego block

05:56.880 --> 06:02.540
that works by itself by reducing dependencies on other parts of the web site.

06:02.580 --> 06:06.390
I can just plug this anywhere I want.

06:06.400 --> 06:12.310
Another important concept with react is the idea of one way data flow.

06:12.390 --> 06:19.200
The best way to describe it is by looking at this tree like structure in here you see that we have a

06:19.200 --> 06:25.110
parent some children and then those children have their own children and those children have their own

06:25.110 --> 06:26.460
children.

06:26.650 --> 06:34.240
And the idea with react is that data flows from top to bottom and never the other way around that is

06:34.570 --> 06:38.380
if these red let's call them components change.

06:38.530 --> 06:44.170
Well in that case only their children know about the change.

06:44.170 --> 06:50.290
The parents don't really care about the change because well the direction of the data flow is just

06:50.290 --> 06:51.440
always downstream.

06:51.490 --> 06:58.750
So if we go back to the idea of components if we had a website built on components and this was the page

06:58.980 --> 07:06.310
and these were organisms and then molecules then atoms.

07:06.380 --> 07:11.110
Well in that case the red components change and then only the ones below it.

07:11.120 --> 07:18.290
As you can see here in blue know of this change and based on that they will act accordingly and change

07:18.290 --> 07:19.170
as well.

07:19.340 --> 07:25.820
Now without actually having a problem it's hard to understand this concept but trust me this is a very

07:25.820 --> 07:29.500
important concept that react brought in.

07:29.510 --> 07:35.870
It creates a lot of really nice bug free code and it is an idea that you'll understand more and more

07:35.900 --> 07:41.300
as we start to code in react.

07:41.540 --> 07:49.600
The next thing is the idea of Virtual DOM you know what the DOM is the Document Object Model.

07:49.730 --> 07:54.950
And we also learned that one of the most important things as a developer is to minimize the amount of

07:54.950 --> 08:01.010
DOM manipulation that we do because well web browsers has to have to work really really hard to achieve

08:01.010 --> 08:05.320
that and it reduces the performance of the webpage plus increases

08:05.330 --> 08:11.160
bugs. I think this image demonstrates what react does really well beforehand.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.840
We were the painters we told the DOM exactly what to do.

08:15.910 --> 08:23.180
Remove this element then put this in and then also add this and color this this way with react

08:23.200 --> 08:30.030
We have this react bot and the react bot creates something called the Virtual DOM, Virtual DOM is

08:30.070 --> 08:37.050
just a JavaScript object and this JavaScript object that just describes our website.

08:37.290 --> 08:46.160
The current state of the website and we just give it that object to react and the react bot will automatically

08:46.160 --> 08:53.240
make changes to the DOM and paint the picture in the most optimum way possible.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.480
So we just tell it hey this is the object.

08:56.660 --> 08:58.140
This is what we want

08:58.640 --> 09:02.960
in the DOM and the react takes care of DOM manipulation for you.

09:02.960 --> 09:11.660
Remember how annoying it was to do query selector-all then grab elements by id and then doing all these event handlers

09:11.660 --> 09:14.480
well react takes care of that.

09:14.480 --> 09:22.430
So again the virtual DOM is just a copy of the DOM that's in a JavaScript object and then react underneath

09:22.430 --> 09:28.910
the hood just changes the view and that's why it's able to work outside of browsers and you can use

09:28.910 --> 09:35.380
things like VR and and mobile devices because react is the machine and what the canvas is on

09:35.390 --> 09:38.960
well we can change the canvas to whatever we want.

09:38.960 --> 09:43.670
Finally react has a great ecosystem.

09:43.750 --> 09:49.540
It is probably one of the biggest ecosystems in JavaScript right now and there are so many tools that

09:49.540 --> 09:56.840
work with react as a matter of fact the developer community is so big that any problem you have there

09:56.910 --> 10:02.250
is most likely a chance that somebody else has had it and has posted it on the Internet and you can

10:02.250 --> 10:03.630
find solutions for.

10:03.690 --> 10:09.810
You can find react packages in npm you can use it with node there's web pack and babel that you

10:09.810 --> 10:10.770
can use with it.

10:11.010 --> 10:18.060
It's just a really good ecosystem that uses the latest JavaScript technology to build websites in a

10:18.060 --> 10:20.490
really nice elegant way.

10:20.500 --> 10:26.630
Now one thing that I want to warn you about in this section we're going to see code like this.

10:27.580 --> 10:30.090
And it's going to look very strange at first.

10:30.250 --> 10:34.900
It's like the same way when you looked at JavaScript the first time.

10:35.030 --> 10:37.400
It seemed like a whole new different world.

10:37.400 --> 10:43.130
It will when you first look at this but trust me knowing what you know about JavaScript this becomes

10:43.250 --> 10:44.690
really really easy.

10:44.720 --> 10:51.740
You have classes that extends the react component and this is how we build components.

10:51.980 --> 11:00.020
We have constructor again that we've seen in advanced objects and then each class has a mandatory render

11:00.110 --> 11:03.860
function that you just tell it what this clock should render.

11:03.890 --> 11:06.970
And as you can see it looks like HTML isn't it.

11:07.400 --> 11:12.020
It's not exactly HTML but the syntax is very similar.

11:12.020 --> 11:16.490
So even by looking at this you see that this clock component.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.170
Again this lego block just returns a Hello World

11:20.180 --> 11:27.730
h1 tag with an h2 that says it is and then the time again just to give you a heads up you're going

11:27.730 --> 11:36.580
to hear words like props and state and react components but these are just language syntax that you'll learn.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.540
And it's actually quite easy once you get used to it.

11:39.890 --> 11:43.730
So don't worry this is all going to make sense

11:43.820 --> 11:49.290
by the end of it. And you know what we're going to be building a pretty cool app.

11:49.350 --> 11:57.170
It's called Robo Friends and we're going to build this app that well searches through your robot friends

11:57.680 --> 11:59.710
and you can find their contact information.

11:59.780 --> 12:03.120
And as you can see it updates live.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.800
It's super fast.

12:04.940 --> 12:06.450
It's responsive.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.600
It's going to be a lot of fun.

12:08.690 --> 12:14.990
And we're going to build this pretty fast just to show you how powerful react is.

12:15.030 --> 12:15.500
All right.

12:15.540 --> 12:17.770
I'm really excited to get into this section.

12:17.850 --> 12:19.400
You're going to have a lot of fun.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.020
I'll see you in the next one.
