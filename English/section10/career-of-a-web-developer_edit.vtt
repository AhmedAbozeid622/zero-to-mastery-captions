WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:06.240
Every decision that will require significant
time of your life should be justified.

00:06.720 --> 00:10.900
And in this video we're going to
talk about career of a web-developer.

00:11.580 --> 00:14.600
Now I'm gonna be talking about
three things specifically

00:14.600 --> 00:17.100
and this is a bit of a unique section unlike

00:17.100 --> 00:20.760
all the other ones where
we just code along and learn new skills.

00:20.900 --> 00:23.280
I want to talk about three things in this video.

00:23.580 --> 00:27.000
One is why would you even want to be a developer.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.200
And I know you're taking the course
I know you're committed but

00:30.200 --> 00:35.860
I want to talk to you about why it is such
a good decision to become a developer

00:35.860 --> 00:38.720
and some of the freedom that
it allows in your life.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.540
The second is
we're going to talk about which tools

00:43.540 --> 00:46.460
you should learn to be a successful developer

00:46.460 --> 00:49.980
And then finally the third,
we're going to talk about

00:49.980 --> 00:53.240
what career options
there are out there currently.

00:53.480 --> 00:58.100
So let's tackle the first one
why you would want to be a developer.

00:58.140 --> 01:00.400
Now I know a lot of people taking this course

01:00.400 --> 01:03.160
aren't necessarily from the States, i'm not either.

01:03.160 --> 01:09.180
But I wanted to show you
how much in-demand a good developer is.

01:09.620 --> 01:13.540
Over here I have some salaries
for developers around the States

01:13.540 --> 01:16.800
and you can see that as a Front-end Developer

01:17.640 --> 01:21.760
You have some really really nice salaries.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.280
A lot higher than most industries.

01:25.440 --> 01:31.120
And if you go to Glassdoor, another website that's
really really good to find out what salaries are

01:31.120 --> 01:34.340
and you can do location specific to you

01:34.560 --> 01:38.660
and I have salaries in San Francisco
which I know, I know

01:38.660 --> 01:42.280
they're way too inflated because
to live there it's very expensive.

01:42.460 --> 01:47.040
But I do want to show you that there is
a real value for developers out there.

01:47.400 --> 01:52.080
I've worked in the industry for many years and
finding a job as a developer

01:52.200 --> 01:55.200
was quite frankly very easy

01:55.200 --> 01:59.400
and I'm not trying to be cocky or
overconfident but it is true.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.280
Speak to any developer that knows
his or her stuff

02:03.660 --> 02:06.960
and they're able to find jobs quite easily.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.540
And most times you're interviewing,
you're interviewing the employer

02:11.560 --> 02:17.120
to see that this is a place that you would
want to work because you have so many options, but

02:17.540 --> 02:21.180
you probably already know this,
you're taking this course for a reason.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.940
So let's talk about what you should learn.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.400
I have for you a couple of surveys here
to show you the industry demand.

02:28.420 --> 02:32.760
The first one is from Jetbrains.
A very very big software company.

02:32.820 --> 02:38.400
and it talks about Javascript and
which frameworks are the most popular.

02:39.480 --> 02:44.080
The one we're going to learn in this course
is React and you can see here, it is

02:44.080 --> 02:47.780
the most popular,
it is probably the most well respected.

02:47.780 --> 02:51.180
And a lot of big companies are using it.

02:51.280 --> 02:55.840
It was developed at Facebook
and now it is used by Netflix

02:55.940 --> 03:01.900
and a ton of other big companies
that do big things technologically.

03:02.180 --> 03:07.500
You can also see that what editors
and IDEs developers regularly use

03:07.500 --> 03:12.840
and we see that Sublime Text is number one
and that is what we are using in this course.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.480
Let's take a look at Stackoverflow

03:16.360 --> 03:20.240
for those that don't know,
Stackoverflow is probably the best

03:20.320 --> 03:22.580
website there is for developers.

03:22.760 --> 03:25.820
Throughout your career,
you'll go on to this website

03:25.820 --> 03:29.340
to ask questions and get answers almost daily.

03:29.540 --> 03:33.360
And one of the things that
they do quite often is a survey

03:33.600 --> 03:36.760
and a Stackoverflow trends analysis

03:36.940 --> 03:39.160
and you can see over here that Javascript

03:39.760 --> 03:44.540
is trending quite quite high
all the way into this year

03:44.540 --> 03:48.120
and into next year, it is a very in demand language.

03:48.120 --> 03:55.620
It can be used on the web, on mobile,
on little devices, pretty much anywhere.

03:55.740 --> 04:01.520
If you can code Javascript, you can code
anything electronic at this point in time.

04:01.780 --> 04:04.240
So that is why we're learning Javascript.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.440
Let's look at the next one.

04:06.700 --> 04:10.480
This one is by Github. And you're going to
get to know Github a lot better

04:10.480 --> 04:14.240
in the section that we will have
for Github and Git.

04:14.420 --> 04:19.900
but I want to show you their stats on open source
projects and you'll see that Javascript

04:19.900 --> 04:24.440
is in the lead with 2.3 million projects.

04:25.220 --> 04:29.000
I love the language.
It's a great language to learn as your first one

04:29.020 --> 04:31.820
and it can take you really really far.

04:32.020 --> 04:36.300
Finally I made this little diagram for us
just so you have a big picture

04:36.300 --> 04:39.120
of what we're going to learn in this course.

04:39.320 --> 04:43.500
We're going to learn basic skills like
putting a website online and

04:43.500 --> 04:47.560
Terminal usage, Git and Github
and RESTful Web services.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.080
We're also going to do front-end work

04:50.080 --> 04:53.340
and some of the videos
have already gone through this.

04:53.660 --> 04:57.540
but we learn HTML5, CSS3.

04:57.900 --> 05:01.700
Now this is kind of interchangeable but
if you want to be a designer

05:01.700 --> 05:06.420
You are more likely going to focus on
CSS, responsive design

05:06.420 --> 05:09.900
and other tools like Photoshop, Sketch
and Illustrator and

05:09.900 --> 05:14.240
this is not the course for it,
we are becoming developers.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.500
So we're going to learn Javascript instead

05:16.740 --> 05:20.560
and Javascript probably has a couple of
libraries and frameworks

05:20.560 --> 05:22.200
that are really really popular.

05:22.200 --> 05:27.780
and the one used most often in mid-2000 was jQuery

05:27.780 --> 05:30.200
but that is now very outdated and

05:30.200 --> 05:35.460
you'll still see it here and there but you won't
see a lot of the big top web sites using it.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.600
So we won't be focusing on that,
we will just cover it slightly

05:38.700 --> 05:43.800
but it is not really an employable skill to learn.

05:44.780 --> 05:48.220
And then I want to draw
your attention to three other

05:48.360 --> 05:51.900
libraries and frameworks and
what those are, are tools

05:51.920 --> 05:56.060
for developers to build web sites and
web applications.

05:56.060 --> 05:58.380
And in this course we're going to learn React

05:58.720 --> 06:02.300
and you'll get to understand the
technology behind that a lot more.

06:02.300 --> 06:09.160
But I chose React because it is currently the
most popular way to build web applications.

06:09.280 --> 06:12.540
And the developer community
around it is very very big.

06:12.800 --> 06:19.500
Angular.js was very popular a few years ago
but it's kind of starting to die down right now.

06:19.500 --> 06:25.240
And I personally think there's a bigger future
with React and some people may disagree but

06:25.900 --> 06:31.640
having worked in the industry and seeing
people's reaction to different technologies

06:31.660 --> 06:35.980
I really think React's going to go really far and
you'll hear a ton about it.

06:37.220 --> 06:42.960
Vue.js is the up-and-comer that it's fairly new,
the community is a lot smaller

06:42.980 --> 06:47.700
so there is not as much information
out there as there is for React

06:47.840 --> 06:53.540
but we won't be covering that topic again because
we're focusing on the most employable skills.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.020
That is Javascript with React.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.850
Finally let's talk about career options.

07:00.850 --> 07:05.110
We're going to talk about the type of work that
you will be able to get as a developer

07:05.110 --> 07:09.870
and some of the confusing job titles that are
out there. So let's start off with the job titles.

07:09.870 --> 07:14.500
You might know what web-developer is because,
well you've signed up for this course. That is

07:14.500 --> 07:18.900
somebody who works on the web,
builds web sites, builds web applications.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.460
We also touched on the back-end developer,
that is the person that

07:23.460 --> 07:26.840
works on the server, works with some databases

07:26.880 --> 07:34.060
and they aren't too concerned with
user facing side of a website or a web app.

07:35.260 --> 07:40.860
A full-stack developer is somebody that can
work both on the frontend and backend

07:40.860 --> 07:42.820
and in this course we're going to learn

07:42.820 --> 07:44.420
both frontend and backend.

07:44.600 --> 07:48.900
So you'll be able to call yourself
a full-stack developer

07:48.900 --> 07:53.880
because you'll understand the full picture of
how these web technologies work.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.480
We also have mobile developer

07:56.560 --> 08:00.400
and the reason that I use React
in this course is that

08:00.440 --> 08:04.100
even though it is a course geared towards
web development

08:04.100 --> 08:08.520
using 90 percent of the things you'll learn
with React, you'll be able to build

08:08.520 --> 08:13.060
an Android app and an iOS app very easily.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.980
And then finally two things at the end here
we have software developer

08:16.980 --> 08:18.500
and that is somebody that

08:18.500 --> 08:25.660
is able to build software not necessarily
on the web, not necessarily on mobile.

08:25.660 --> 08:31.440
They're able to use a programming language
to build software, that is

08:31.440 --> 08:34.280
code that can be run anywhere.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.300
And then finally, software engineers use
computer science

08:40.300 --> 08:43.700
to solve complex machine problems.

08:44.340 --> 08:48.260
And that is a very very broad statement, but it is.

08:48.260 --> 08:52.840
They're not necessarily good at
one coding language, they're good at

08:52.840 --> 08:55.160
working with machines.

08:55.540 --> 09:00.300
So I just wanted to throw that out there so
you know what the differences are

09:00.300 --> 09:02.600
when you are looking for jobs out there.

09:03.240 --> 09:08.080
Now let's talk about the fun stuff.
The type of work you'll be able to do

09:08.080 --> 09:09.820
when you become a web developer.

09:10.500 --> 09:14.020
and ideally if you go full force into this course

09:14.020 --> 09:19.220
and you really learn the concepts that we
cover in this course, the type of work that

09:19.220 --> 09:20.800
you can do with this.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.000
So the first one is entrepreneurship.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.660
And obviously when you're able to build web sites

09:25.660 --> 09:29.640
and you're able to build
landing pages and applications,

09:29.640 --> 09:32.040
well you could start your own business

09:32.040 --> 09:34.880
if you have that ambition and idea

09:34.880 --> 09:38.840
then entrepreneurship is definitely
a good avenue to go.

09:38.840 --> 09:42.880
And it is part of the reason that
I myself became a developer initially.

09:43.500 --> 09:47.800
The second one is startups, if you want
to work for young companies that

09:47.800 --> 09:55.560
are moving fast and creating some really
cool technologies or innovations

09:55.560 --> 09:58.640
well, startups are always
looking for developers.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.080
We also have 'Freelance' and that is being
able to work on (your) own terms and

10:03.080 --> 10:05.980
you know, using websites like Upwork to

10:05.980 --> 10:10.300
look for contract jobs and build
quick projects for people

10:10.300 --> 10:12.180
around the world as they need fit.

10:12.180 --> 10:15.380
And you know,
running a little business for yourself.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.800
The next one is working for
the big tech companies, so

10:19.800 --> 10:24.220
that's Facebook, Google, Amazon
if you're in the States.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.440
If you're somewhere else around the world

10:26.440 --> 10:30.220
you have your own big tech companies

10:30.220 --> 10:33.700
and they are always a great place

10:33.700 --> 10:37.220
to get hired as a developer because
they have massive teams.

10:37.220 --> 10:41.160
They're solving really really
big problems and they need

10:41.160 --> 10:44.180
all the developer knowledge that they can get.

10:44.180 --> 10:48.240
It is not for everybody but they are great places

10:48.240 --> 10:52.200
to be surrounded by really really
smart people and learn from them.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.420
We also have ad agencies, so ad agencies
always have contracts where

10:57.420 --> 11:01.060
they have a company that is working with them

11:01.060 --> 11:05.940
and they usually need some sort of a website
or a promo site built for them

11:05.940 --> 11:08.300
and they have staff developers

11:08.300 --> 11:12.120
that help them work on these
different projects with different clients.

11:12.500 --> 11:16.340
And then finally I bolded this
and that is remote work.

11:17.040 --> 11:21.020
I know a lot of developers that
get into development because

11:21.020 --> 11:24.200
of this ideal of being able to work remotely and

11:24.320 --> 11:26.650
you know what, that is absolutely true.

11:26.650 --> 11:30.910
If that is the type of life that you want and
that is the type of career that you want

11:30.910 --> 11:36.900
working remotely is definitely something that
a developer is able to do, because

11:36.900 --> 11:41.860
lets be honest, to be a developer
all you need is an Internet connection

11:42.060 --> 11:46.860
and you don't necessarily need to be
face to face with a client, with a co-worker

11:46.860 --> 11:51.840
with an employer because like I said,
everything is on a computer.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.260
So that is not for everybody

11:54.460 --> 11:58.060
but it is an option and it is
an attractive option for some.

11:59.700 --> 12:03.660
So what was the meaning of this video then?

12:04.180 --> 12:08.620
Well we went over a few things because
I wanted you to understand

12:08.620 --> 12:11.140
what we are doing in this course, but

12:11.240 --> 12:15.000
there's an important point
I really want to emphasize, that is

12:15.140 --> 12:20.180
to keep in mind that when you start off something
like learning development skills

12:20.780 --> 12:26.160
the first two months will feel like you are
climbing an insurmountable mountain.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.600
Every video or course or tutorial or

12:29.600 --> 12:32.040
book that you read is going to make you feel like

12:32.040 --> 12:35.740
you're the only person in the world that
doesn't know this stuff, but

12:36.120 --> 12:38.060
I'm here to tell you to stay strong.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.860
I went through it, every single developer
has gone through it.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.680
You'll get there and you will have

12:43.680 --> 12:47.420
more and more 'aha!' moments as time progresses

12:47.880 --> 12:50.580
and we even have a word for this in the industry

12:50.580 --> 12:53.400
it's called the 'imposter syndrome'
where you feel like

12:53.400 --> 12:56.280
you're the only one who
doesn't know this information.

12:57.160 --> 13:01.400
Rest assured, we all feel this way
when we learn something new.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.140
What you'll learn is that being a good developer

13:04.140 --> 13:08.160
isn't necessarily memorizing
a whole bunch of documentation or code.

13:08.220 --> 13:13.360
It's about learning how to solve problems
using all the tools that are available to you.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.780
And I'm going to leave you with that.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.560
Being a developer isn't easy.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.840
You really do need to know your stuff.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.500
So follow along this course and

13:23.500 --> 13:27.650
really engage in all the lessons
and all the exercises.

13:27.650 --> 13:30.220
And if you have questions, ask them

13:30.220 --> 13:35.400
because in-demand developers are
problem solvers, not just coders.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.400
Can't wait to see you in the next video. Bye-bye
