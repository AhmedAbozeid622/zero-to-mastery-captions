00:01.120 --> 00:02.140
Welcome back.

00:02.140 --> 00:03.910
It's time to learn Node JS.

00:04.030 --> 00:06.950
Now Node JS

00:07.060 --> 00:11.920
We've kind of used it in previous videos but we haven't really explained it.

00:11.920 --> 00:18.070
So throughout this section we're going to learn what it is and finally use it to build a server.

00:19.640 --> 00:27.180
Now I may have mentioned this before but Node is JavaScript that runs on your machine.

00:27.180 --> 00:34.140
You see up until Node was created you could only run JavaScript in the browser because the browsers

00:34.140 --> 00:43.990
were the only ones that had a JavaScript engine like V8 and Node JS was created with the V8 engine in

00:43.990 --> 00:51.400
order to be able to run JavaScript anywhere including your computer including on robots and anywhere

00:51.430 --> 00:53.450
as long as you had Node JS.

00:54.460 --> 01:00.970
And as a matter of fact we've been using Node this entire time in our Terminal when we ran commands

01:01.030 --> 01:05.420
that NPM gave us like 'create-react-app'.

01:05.410 --> 01:10.540
Well that was using Node; we were running JavaScript outside of the browser.

01:12.010 --> 01:17.320
And Node JS is probably most popular for building servers.

01:17.320 --> 01:24.040
It's really really fast and more and more companies are using it now as a back-end server because of

01:24.040 --> 01:26.760
the way that it's built.

01:26.770 --> 01:27.110
-

01:27.170 --> 01:31.130
Node JS is probably the server of choice for any web apps or

01:31.350 --> 01:35.230
mobile apps out there that want to create an API or a server.

01:35.470 --> 01:40.490
And it's also really really good at building chat applications and realtime communication.

01:41.060 --> 01:45.970
Anyway as we've mentioned before you probably should have this on your computer by now but if not you

01:45.970 --> 01:47.080
can download

01:47.110 --> 01:47.450
-

01:47.490 --> 01:47.880
Node JS.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.170
I like using the LTS version.

01:50.990 --> 01:56.540
But as long as the version that you're using is higher than 8.9.3, this demonstration

01:56.600 --> 01:58.070
will work for you.

01:58.070 --> 02:01.350
Node is really really good at making sure that everything is compatible.

02:01.430 --> 02:08.150
Again if you're using a Windows operating system then Node provides that for you in the download section

02:08.150 --> 02:08.700
as well.

02:09.850 --> 02:15.950
And again to check Node, it's very easy we just do 'node -v' to see that we have it.

02:16.180 --> 02:23.490
And if you do have it you'll have the version number printed for you on the console. One last thing

02:23.490 --> 02:30.940
before I show you some Node commands: like I said before Node can be run anywhere.

02:32.130 --> 02:38.250
And one of my favorite things to do with Node, other than build servers is to actually create robots using

02:38.250 --> 02:39.410
JavaScript.

02:39.400 --> 02:46.860
This Johnny-5 is a JavaScript library that you can use with Node and if you have something like a Raspberry

02:46.860 --> 02:55.310
Pi, it helps you build functions using JavaScript that robots can perform.

02:55.740 --> 03:00.640
So I highly highly recommend it after this course if you want to explore more.

03:00.660 --> 03:08.370
Johnny-5 is one of my favorite things and it's surprising how easy it is to build a robot that does

03:08.370 --> 03:12.590
whatever you want it to do just using JavaScript.

03:12.620 --> 03:18.670
But anyway let's go back to Node. In your Terminal,

03:18.670 --> 03:27.550
if you actually type in 'node' and press Enter you'll see that the prompt changes now, and I can run Node

03:27.960 --> 03:31.530
in the terminal. If I do 'console.log('hi')'

03:35.250 --> 03:47.570
I get 'hi'. If I do '4 + 5' I get 9 and if I do 'Boolaen(3)' whoops I spelt that wrong, 'Boolean(3)'

03:50.130 --> 03:51.930
I get true.

03:52.380 --> 03:58.450
As you can see we're just running JavaScript but there is a bit of a difference here.

03:58.570 --> 04:07.510
If I type in 'window' I get a 'ReferenceError: window is not defined' and let me clear this a little bit.

04:07.510 --> 04:14.680
This is because when we run Node we don't have the window object; the window object was provided to us

04:15.070 --> 04:16.570
by the browser.

04:16.930 --> 04:20.800
And as you know, Node, well there's no browser that's running it.

04:20.800 --> 04:25.020
Instead Node comes with something called 'global'.

04:25.210 --> 04:31.780
And you can see that this 'global' has just like that window object had, a bunch of things that we can use

04:32.500 --> 04:35.490
but it won't have browser-specific things.

04:36.410 --> 04:48.260
For example we won't be able to have 'global.fetch' â it's undefined because well it doesn't exist.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.090
That was provided to us by the browser.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.810
We also don't have the 'document' object,

04:53.880 --> 05:00.120
if you remember; if I do 'document' again I get a reference error because well there's no document; so that's

05:00.120 --> 05:01.670
something to keep in mind.

05:01.770 --> 05:08.130
Node comes with its own properties and methods that we use but other than browser-specific things,

05:08.130 --> 05:11.210
we can do anything we want with Node.

05:11.310 --> 05:16.100
One of the global objects that we have is something called 'process'.

05:16.250 --> 05:24.680
If I press Enter again I have a ton of stuff, and in Node, 'process' means 'this process' â what I'm running

05:24.680 --> 05:28.890
right now in the Terminal is the process, what the computer is doing.

05:30.330 --> 05:30.570
All right.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.260
And let's just clear this.

05:33.460 --> 05:43.490
Now if I do 'process.exit' I exit this process and now I'm back to my Terminal.

05:43.680 --> 05:50.370
Now that we have Node in our power we're going to start writing some script and show you how we can

05:50.370 --> 05:56.090
start writing actual JavaScript, not in the Terminal but in Sublime Text.

05:56.370 --> 05:58.110
I'll see in the next video.

05:58.110 --> 05:58.350
Bye-bye.
