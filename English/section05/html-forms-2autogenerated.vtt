I want to introduce you to one last form element and it's actually not an input with a type, as we've

00:09.050 --> 00:14.370
described before, it's a little bit different. but the idea is still the same.

00:14.570 --> 00:23.780
So let's add "Cars:" here and we want this to be a drop-down menu. Again, something that we see very often

00:24.110 --> 00:25.480
in form fields.

00:25.520 --> 00:35.580
However, unlike an input tag, we have to do a ‘select’ tag, needs a ‘/select’ tag as well.

00:35.930 --> 00:39.090
And within here, we can put in our options.

00:39.440 --> 00:51.480
So the option will be, will have a value of "volvo" not "volco" and we'll say "Volvo" because we want that

00:52.350 --> 00:54.010
actually printed to the screen.

00:54.990 --> 00:58.980
And again we have to close that tag. We'll add

01:02.770 --> 01:03.200
"Audi"

01:06.170 --> 01:09.170
and we'll close that tag as well and we can keep adding them.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.020
But for now, just two is fine.

01:12.020 --> 01:18.380
If I save this and I refresh, we have cars, let's add a ‘br’ tag here.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.360
Just so it looks nicer.

01:22.380 --> 01:22.920
There you go.

01:23.190 --> 01:27.050
And here now, we have a dropdown menu.

01:27.300 --> 01:32.100
Let's say you want to extend this or you want to see what kind of properties, you can put with select

01:32.220 --> 01:33.680
the way you go about it.

01:33.720 --> 01:41.990
As you know we've done this before, we type in "html select tag" and actually Google gives you a nice little

01:42.080 --> 01:47.540
info page over here with attributes, so you can see over here, we can use "multiple", which is "specifies

01:47.540 --> 01:50.590
that multiple options can be selected at once".

01:50.630 --> 02:04.440
So, let's do that, let's let's minimize this. perfect. and within select, we'll put "multiple". we refresh, and

02:04.440 --> 02:08.430
we can actually select multiple elements.

02:08.850 --> 02:13.740
But that doesn't look that pretty. So I'm going to take that out [deletes "multiple" from ‘select’ tag] and refresh.

02:13.740 --> 02:20.010
I actually realized that, we forgot one important input type. So I'm going to throw it in there as a

02:20.010 --> 02:20.610
bonus.

02:20.730 --> 02:26.280
And as you know with any registration form we want a password.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.030
So let's add that right after the email.

02:32.270 --> 02:33.190
We'll do.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.340
input

02:35.340 --> 02:44.610
type and yes there is a "password" type that we can add and this "password" type will have another attribute

02:44.610 --> 02:52.720
that's kind of cool and that is "min", which is how many, the minimum characters that a password needs.

02:52.740 --> 02:58.290
Ok. So let's, save that, refresh and let's add a ‘br’ tag here.

02:58.470 --> 03:02.140
So, it looks pretty, refresh.

03:02.200 --> 03:08.350
And now the password field, look at that, it acts like a password field.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.080
All right.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.150
Let's submit this form and see what happens.
