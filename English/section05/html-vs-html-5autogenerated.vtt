00:01.100 --> 00:03.470
Wow! good job for still hanging in there.

00:03.500 --> 00:08.420
It only gets more and more exciting from here, we're just scratching the surface with the power that

00:08.420 --> 00:10.650
comes, with being a web developer.

00:10.970 --> 00:16.310
But I want to quickly talk about HTML vs HTML5.

00:16.610 --> 00:23.550
I've mentioned this topic a few times, but just kind of brushed it off and told you, yeah this is HTML

00:23.570 --> 00:24.960
Yeah this is HTML5.

00:24.980 --> 00:33.290
But I wanted to just take a break and quickly go over the basic concept, of what HTML5 is?

00:33.290 --> 00:44.270
If you remember in our diagram, HTML, when it first, got started in 1989 to 1991, it wasn't as elaborate.

00:44.270 --> 00:46.880
It didn't have as many features, as it has now.

00:46.880 --> 00:55.340
We want to make sure that, all these browsers play nicely and understand, our HTML rules.

00:55.490 --> 01:02.300
So if you remember, our friend Tim, our first web developer, the guy who created the world wide web, has

01:02.300 --> 01:09.380
a governing body, that establishes what HTML should look like, so that these individual browsers know

01:09.380 --> 01:12.850
how to code their browser, so that it reads HTML properly.

01:12.930 --> 01:18.610
And obviously the web that we had in the 90s, is very different than the one, that we have now.

01:18.620 --> 01:25.860
So there's a lot of new things that, we need to update and some of those things are.

01:26.360 --> 01:35.930
You know we have phones and we have tablets and just overall, we need more power from HTML.

01:35.930 --> 01:43.130
So, HTML5 was the evolution and there's, there are many many evolutions of HTML, HTML5 is the latest

01:43.130 --> 01:51.230
one, where we try to add on features so that, we can improve the user experience.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.650
Now, what are some of those features?

01:53.750 --> 02:00.630
Let's take a quick look, at our good old friend, W3 schools.

02:00.780 --> 02:06.960
One of the things that HTML5 wants to do is, well we want to make sure that it doesn't affect

02:07.110 --> 02:13.460
any old web site, if you remember our very first web site from Tim, maybe in 1991.

02:13.740 --> 02:18.720
Well, that still works to this day, we visited it in the previous videos.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.420
You can still visit Web sites from the 90s, because we want to make sure that everything is backwards

02:24.450 --> 02:25.110
compatible.

02:25.110 --> 02:28.880
That's a fancy way of saying, older versions are not obsolete.

02:28.890 --> 02:35.390
But we also want to tack on these features and you can read on the Web site, all the information of HTML5

02:35.400 --> 02:41.880
and what it does and some of the things that it supports and it does get a little technical and

02:41.940 --> 02:43.860
we don't need to get into it, too much.

02:43.860 --> 02:51.630
But the one thing that I want to emphasize that, it introduced this idea of semantic elements and what

02:51.630 --> 02:59.370
that means is, they wanted to make Web sites more descriptive, search engines such as Google, go on websites

02:59.370 --> 03:03.570
and they use these things called crawlers, to look through your Web site.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.850
These machines, that are reading your HTML, to understand what your web site is?, what the topic about

03:08.850 --> 03:17.370
it is?, so that they can rank it in search engines and HTML5 semantic elements, tries to add a little

03:17.370 --> 03:23.690
bit more meaning for these robots, so that when they encounter something, it makes a little bit more sense.

03:23.700 --> 03:29.360
So, this is an example, of some of these new tags, that HTML5 introduced.

03:29.430 --> 03:32.430
And let's show you a few of them.

03:32.490 --> 03:38.410
For example, if we wanted to say, that we want to comment this out, we know how to do that already.

03:38.610 --> 03:50.070
And a semantic element, would maybe look like ‘header’ where we have the title ‘h1’ which is "Register"

03:53.020 --> 03:59.290
and we close the ‘/header’ so that now, the crawler knows that, this is our header and maybe we have some

03:59.950 --> 04:01.010
navigation ‘nav’ links.

04:01.030 --> 04:12.130
So now, we can have ’a’ tags with our 'href' and we'll just say that, it links to Google and then we close

04:12.130 --> 04:12.710
the ‘nav’.

04:12.790 --> 04:18.430
We only have one navigation link for now,  but I just wanted to demonstrate quickly.

04:18.630 --> 04:32.670
And finally we have a ‘footer’, so within the ‘footer’, we can add something like "Website made with love".

04:34.150 --> 04:41.410
and you can see over here that, this even to a machine, if it understands what ‘header’ means, and ‘nav’ means,

04:41.410 --> 04:48.580
and ‘footer’ means, gives a lot more meaning to the web page and it'll have a better idea of, how the website

04:48.580 --> 04:55.030
is structured and where it's their rank and their Google search results. You can take your time and read

04:55.030 --> 04:56.580
through some of these tags.

04:56.590 --> 05:03.250
And I do recommend that, you visit this Web site and go through some of the HTML intro, you'll even

05:03.250 --> 05:08.830
see that, if we click on ‘input’ types or something that we visited already and we scroll to some of the

05:08.830 --> 05:16.600
attributes, you'll see that there some new HTML5, they have these little icon over here, that have

05:16.600 --> 05:23.130
been introduced, so we're constantly expanding to make HTML better and better functionality.

05:23.140 --> 05:29.230
You can see here 'min', for example, we use that for password, if you remember, specifies the minimum value

05:29.230 --> 05:30.040
for an input field.

05:30.040 --> 05:40.840
So if I set a 'min' over here, then it make sure that, I enter the minimum amount of value.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.840
But again, you can take a look at it yourself.

05:44.040 --> 05:48.880
The issue with semantic web is, that it's still fairly new.

05:49.080 --> 06:01.090
So you won't see as much, of this, you will on some Web sites, but it's very hard to prove that it actually

06:01.090 --> 06:07.540
has good SEO performance because it's still fairly early, but just so you don't get surprised and you're

06:07.570 --> 06:10.310
aware of what's happening.

06:10.390 --> 06:18.000
It is something that you might encounter, but overall HTML5 tries to, improve the performance of

06:18.000 --> 06:20.200
the web , because we're constantly evolving.

06:20.340 --> 06:29.160
And just like Web sites, need to go from simple HTML text based Web site to massive web sites like

06:29.190 --> 06:36.630
Twitter, that you can post and talk to millions of people around the world, where we need our web technologies

06:36.630 --> 06:39.220
to evolve with us.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.890
I'll see you in the next one. Bye Bye
