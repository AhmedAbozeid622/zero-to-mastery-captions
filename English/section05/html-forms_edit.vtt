WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.730
And welcome back.

00:02.750 --> 00:10.190
We're going to get into some more advanced tags and probably the most important tag that you'll use, other than

00:10.220 --> 00:16.910
the ones that we've covered so far, are tags that we need, to create forms. As you know, when you go to

00:16.910 --> 00:23.570
Web sites usually there's some sort of a login or registration form, so we're going to build that

00:23.570 --> 00:28.660
out today. To get started, let's just create a new file here.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.110
We'll save it and call it "register.html"

00:32.150 --> 00:42.280
on our desktop. Perfect. And we know that we want an "html". So we can use our little shortcut and we'll title

00:42.280 --> 00:43.890
it "Register".

00:44.030 --> 00:56.240
Save that and now in the "index.html" file, let's add another link that references "register.html" and

00:56.240 --> 00:58.290
I'll just say here,

00:58.590 --> 00:59.920
"Register" right.

01:00.240 --> 01:05.370
We'll save both of these files and let's refresh.

01:05.370 --> 01:11.340
We have "Register". click "Register", while we have nothing yet, but it looks like it's working.

01:11.380 --> 01:15.400
Let's add this on a new line, just because it looks prettier that way.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.640
So to do that, if you remember we're going to add a break ‘br’ tag.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.030
So let's refresh.

01:21.070 --> 01:21.670
There you go.

01:21.670 --> 01:24.940
We have "new page" and "register".

01:24.960 --> 01:25.240
OK.

01:25.310 --> 01:34.350
So let's build out this form. If you go into "register.html", the way we write forms in HTML.

01:34.360 --> 01:39.560
Well conveniently there is a ‘form’ tag.

01:39.590 --> 01:44.050
OK. But this ‘form’ tag itself needs to have the actual form inside of it.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.970
So what kind of form elements do we have?

01:47.980 --> 01:55.710
Well, again if we remember our good old friend "W3C", lets type in "w3c forms".

01:57.350 --> 02:03.440
And we can see over here, that we have HTML forms and refresh.

02:03.650 --> 02:10.380
We'll make that full screen and you can see over here that, there is a ton of information on it, but you

02:10.380 --> 02:12.790
can look that up yourself, for now.

02:13.690 --> 02:18.340
I'm going to introduce you to the most common ones, probably the ones that you'll use 90 percent of the

02:18.340 --> 02:18.780
time.

02:19.860 --> 02:22.090
The first one as we do with any form.

02:22.110 --> 02:26.550
And let's go to that page for now, is well we want to enter our name.

02:26.550 --> 02:27.350
So how do we do that?

02:27.360 --> 02:39.800
We have a ‘input’ tag, that has a 'type' of "text", because well our name will be in "text" form and we can

02:39.800 --> 02:43.660
close that off and it's actually a self closing tag.

02:43.820 --> 02:50.070
So now, if I save and hit refresh. OK. we have a little box here.

02:50.150 --> 02:51.460
Hopefully you can see that.

02:51.550 --> 02:55.880
But, well we should probably title it, because we won't know what to enter that way. so we're going to

02:55.880 --> 03:05.180
put in here, we're going to say "First Name:" and save. let's refresh. We have first name.

03:05.300 --> 03:08.590
And now. let's make this a little bit bigger.

03:08.590 --> 03:09.240
There you go.

03:09.470 --> 03:14.450
Now, you can enter your name in here. Awesome.

03:15.020 --> 03:18.240
Well let's add another one for "Last Name:".

03:22.780 --> 03:27.340
And again we'll have, our "input type".

03:27.340 --> 03:29.990
So that's an attribute and a value of 'text'.

03:32.430 --> 03:34.990
And if we refresh, we have "Last Name".

03:35.230 --> 03:35.720
OK.

03:35.730 --> 03:41.490
But, it kinda looks ugly. remember that HTML, just reads line by line and doesn't really know

03:41.490 --> 03:51.730
that we want a space here, so again, we can add a break ‘br’ tag here and refresh and we have first name and

03:51.880 --> 03:53.550
last name.

03:53.590 --> 03:53.960
OK.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.920
That's, that's fairly self-explanatory.

03:57.040 --> 04:01.670
Now, what else do we have in a form? we have e-mail.

04:01.750 --> 04:05.460
So let's let's add another field, which is "Email:".

04:06.040 --> 04:15.530
And we'll do input again, type equals text, we'll add another ‘br’ here because we're going to need that spacing

04:16.700 --> 04:18.940
and let's save. refresh.

04:19.160 --> 04:27.980
Awesome. OK so we have our general registration form and obviously with any form, we need some sort of

04:27.980 --> 04:28.560
buttons.

04:28.620 --> 04:32.800
Like, we need to submit this somewhere, so we can register.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.830
Well, again there's a nice input type for that.

04:36.890 --> 04:40.300
So we do input, instead of a text type,

04:40.340 --> 04:53.790
there is a "submit" type. So this, if we add another break in here and I save this. I refresh. It has a submit

04:53.790 --> 04:54.340
button now.

04:55.250 --> 04:58.760
Now, where did this "submit" come from.

04:58.760 --> 05:03.500
Well, when you put an input type "submit" it automatically creates a button.

05:03.530 --> 05:07.510
And if you don't specify what to say, It'll just have this text.

05:07.520 --> 05:15.110
But, we can change that, so we can put value and we'll put.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.260
"Register".

05:16.830 --> 05:18.970
Save that. refresh.

05:19.090 --> 05:29.740
We now have a "Register!" button. ok. But what if, we make mistakes in this field, we write stuff and what we

05:29.740 --> 05:36.340
want to reset this form. Again there's another input for that.

05:36.910 --> 05:43.040
And the type of that input as you can imagine is "reset".

05:43.050 --> 05:49.530
So now, if we close this. Add another break tag in here. actually we can keep that on the same line. we'll save.

05:49.860 --> 05:52.580
refresh. and we have "Reset".

05:52.580 --> 05:56.840
So now if I type in anything in here and let's say I don't want to.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.110
Well, I don't like this, I need to reset the form.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.500
I can just click "Reset" and it clears everything for us.

06:03.270 --> 06:03.640
OK.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.150
You may be asking yourself, "You know what,

06:06.230 --> 06:10.410
well, what happens when we click 'Register’?", before we get into that,

06:10.420 --> 06:15.850
I want to just go through all the common input types and then we'll click "Register" to see what happens.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.420
With the e-mail,

06:18.550 --> 06:24.610
we ideally want, first of all for it to be required, so that when you click register if you haven't provided

06:24.610 --> 06:27.550
an email, it won't let you register.

06:27.850 --> 06:33.770
And there's an attribute that, we can use for that and that is "required".

06:33.820 --> 06:41.290
And here we don't actually have to specify a value, because automatically it's assumed that required

06:41.320 --> 06:45.150
equals to true, which means that this form field is required.

06:45.400 --> 06:55.770
So if I save that. I refresh. And I leave it blank and I click register. It'll say please fill out, this field.

06:55.780 --> 07:00.130
Now, we also want to make sure that, it's an appropriate e-mail field.

07:00.150 --> 07:06.200
So if I type something like this. we still want to make sure that, you know, this is an incorrect e-mail.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.300
We don't want to register.

07:08.420 --> 07:12.400
So the input type of text that I told you for email, is actually wrong.

07:12.400 --> 07:17.140
There's a specific one that we can use, which is, as you can imagine, "email".

07:17.540 --> 07:26.980
So now if I refresh and type in something that's not an email and I click register. I'll say please include

07:27.010 --> 07:30.780
an "@" in the email address. Very nice.

07:30.790 --> 07:34.150
It's kind of like magic. it does this for you, which is very very nice.

07:34.980 --> 07:40.450
Let's expand on our knowledge, of inputs and add a few more fields, that we'll most likely need.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.410
Usually, want to know somebody's birthday.

07:44.580 --> 07:52.830
So lets, add birthday here and for this input type let's do type "date".

07:55.570 --> 08:04.650
so if I save this and I refresh. Look at that, we have a nice little date picker, so I can pick anything in

08:04.650 --> 08:05.060
here.

08:06.540 --> 08:06.860
All right.

08:06.870 --> 08:07.860
What else do we need.

08:07.860 --> 08:10.230
We also need "Gender".

08:10.440 --> 08:11.730
So we'll do input.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.320
type and for gender,

08:14.340 --> 08:22.730
Well there's no specific input type for gender. but there is something called 'radio' and radio is as the name

08:22.730 --> 08:25.500
suggest radio buttons.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.450
So now, I click refresh.

08:28.450 --> 08:35.060
And well, I have one radio button, but we ideally want to have options right, so how do we do that.

08:35.060 --> 08:43.250
So for the radio, we also need to say, whether it's male or female, let's have within the gender.

08:43.320 --> 08:54.460
We're going to have a break tag over here in the line and we'll say input type "radio" and we'll say "Male"

08:55.200 --> 09:02.420
and we also want "Female" and we also want "Other"

09:05.520 --> 09:10.560
and when we refresh this, we have "Male", "Female" and "Other".

09:10.560 --> 09:16.740
But you see a problem here, I just click the radio buttons and I can't de-select them and ideally, you

09:16.740 --> 09:20.030
can only - you should only be able to select one.

09:20.400 --> 09:25.830
And right now the way, the radio buttons are, they don't know of each others existance, we want to make sure

09:25.830 --> 09:32.060
that, they know that they're connected. They're family and only one of them can be picked.

09:32.070 --> 09:37.230
So how do we do that. The way we do that is, through the "name" attribute.

09:37.530 --> 09:47.600
So for the name we'll say "gender" and this name attribute, needs to match on all the radio buttons. so

09:47.600 --> 09:56.600
that they know, they are together, they're part of the "gender" input field. So if I save here and refresh

09:58.390 --> 10:03.690
Now, you can see that I can only select one.

10:03.700 --> 10:04.110
All right.

10:04.110 --> 10:04.830
Perfect.

10:04.860 --> 10:06.500
What else should we have.

10:06.510 --> 10:13.090
Well lets say, what I really want to know if you have pets. So with pets.

10:14.600 --> 10:24.660
We're going to have "input" "type". We can have multiple pets, so it won't be radio buttons. We want 'checkbox'.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.660
So checkbox.

10:25.660 --> 10:35.380
We want it to have cats, or let's just put "Cat".  and we want to have

10:38.620 --> 10:39.650
- can't type today.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.870
Check box and we want to have "Dogs".

10:47.080 --> 10:48.260
So let's save that.

10:48.310 --> 10:51.090
Let's refresh and look at that.

10:51.340 --> 10:58.030
We have "Pets". But this time, it's checkboxes which means, I can select multiple.
