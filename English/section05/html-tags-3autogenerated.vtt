Hello and welcome back.

00:03.280 --> 00:09.520
I'm excited to show you a few more tags, before we get into some fun things, that we can do with HTML

00:09.520 --> 00:12.090
now and we can finish up the course.

00:12.130 --> 00:20.370
You may be wondering, hey! what if maybe, I'm working with a team and we're all working on the same HTML

00:20.380 --> 00:30.850
file and I want to, maybe, have a comment in there, to let them know that maybe, here "Use GET, not POST"

00:31.930 --> 00:37.750
Let's, capitalize it, if we just do this the way it is.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.230
It's kind of, show up on the Web site, we just want it as a comment, so that people who look at the code

00:42.770 --> 00:45.910
can see it without affecting the website.

00:46.100 --> 00:55.300
Well, HTML has a way to comment and the way you do that, is like this

00:56.740 --> 01:01.210
"Use GET, not POST"

01:01.210 --> 01:08.230
Now, that's kind of tedious to write. In sublime text, you can do that by holding 'COMMAND + /'

01:08.230 --> 01:17.310
and you can do it that way. If you have a Windows based laptop or computer, that is the 'CTRL + /'

01:17.310 --> 01:19.030
*/ Not 'windows + /' /*

01:19.110 --> 01:21.470
So that's how, we write comments.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.640
And if I save this. Oops that's not what I wanted to do.

01:24.720 --> 01:30.940
If I save this and refresh, nothing shows up.

01:30.940 --> 01:31.680
Perfect.

01:31.840 --> 01:41.800
And then, the last two tags that I'm going to show you, are the ‘div’ tags for division and the ‘span’ tags

01:42.460 --> 01:44.390
these tags are,

01:44.440 --> 01:46.440
how can I say this, useless right now.

01:46.810 --> 01:52.280
And it's because they're used to divide content.

01:52.440 --> 02:04.500
So ‘div’ tag, you're going to see in a lot of web pages, are used like this, to let's say, wrap the form.

02:04.640 --> 02:10.610
So by doing this, let's see if it does anything.

02:10.720 --> 02:17.370
Nope!, everything looks exact same, but this is very powerful when we get into CSS.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.730
Because what this allows us to do, is to divide up our content.

02:21.730 --> 02:28.460
Imagine if we had a registration form here, maybe another piece of content, maybe an image up here.

02:28.570 --> 02:36.640
‘div’ tag allows us to add styles and divide up the content into each different section, so that, each section

02:36.640 --> 02:40.960
of our Web site, can have its own little box.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.480
So you're going to see this a lot, in the CSS section.

02:44.530 --> 02:47.600
But for now just keep that in mind, so there's no surprises.

02:47.770 --> 02:58.990
‘span’ tag is the same thing except, ‘span’ tag is a inline element, so an inline element is different from a block

02:59.110 --> 03:10.980
element because with ,’span’ tag we can just add it to a specific line, so we can do ‘span’ and ‘/span’.

03:11.130 --> 03:15.520
And again, this won't do anything, if I refresh.

03:15.750 --> 03:16.720
Nothing happens.

03:16.860 --> 03:25.020
But now inline, we can add some styles only to the "First Name:" and we can emphasize it, so these are

03:25.020 --> 03:32.020
just tags that we can use as tools, when we want to have a container, an invisible container, around a

03:32.040 --> 03:34.850
piece of element and are HTML.

03:34.920 --> 03:39.450
that perhaps you want to add some style to or have some specific functionality to.

03:39.450 --> 03:46.920
So again, we're not going to worry about adding these, to our current web site, but I wanted to show you

03:46.920 --> 03:50.110
that those do exist and we're going to encounter those

03:50.260 --> 03:52.060
in the CSS chapter.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.570
That's it for now.

03:53.570 --> 03:54.440
Talk to you soon.
