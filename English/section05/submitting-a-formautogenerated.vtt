WEBVTT

00:01.050 --> 00:04.340
OK! OK! Andrei, can we finally submit this form?!

00:04.410 --> 00:04.710
All right.

00:04.740 --> 00:08.580
And this video will finally see, what happens when we submit this form?

00:09.060 --> 00:16.910
But, there is one last thing, that we need to include and that is the "name" attributes.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.420
And then I'll explain.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.980
Towards the end of this video, why we need those.

00:21.030 --> 00:28.850
So we want to add, in each one of our fields, a "name" attribute. So this one will be "firstname" and I'm just

00:28.860 --> 00:31.800
going to copy and paste here, just so it'll be a little bit faster.

00:31.800 --> 00:46.700
We have "lastname", "email", "password", "birthday" and we already have these four, the radio buttons, which is good.

00:46.920 --> 00:51.090
And we need here "cat", "dog".

00:51.410 --> 00:54.680
"volvo", "audi" */It's "audi" not "volvo"/*.

00:54.700 --> 00:58.310
Okay. Now we don't need it for the buttons, because well there's no user information there.

00:59.120 --> 01:04.970
So, I'm going to save that and I'm going to make this full screen, so you can see, I'm going to refresh

01:04.970 --> 01:10.450
the page and let's enter some fake data and see what happens.

01:10.460 --> 01:21.610
So I'm going to say "fake", "man", e-mail address is fake password will be "123", birthday, "male", with

01:21.610 --> 01:24.620
a "cat" and has an "audi".

01:24.770 --> 01:27.550
I'm going to click "Register!" now, but keep an eye out.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.460
Up over here.

01:28.470 --> 01:33.320
To See what happens, when I click. Did you catch that?!

01:33.680 --> 01:43.130
Let's copy this, because when I clicked "Register!", this got attached. I am going to minimize this and print

01:43.130 --> 01:45.280
this out here, so we can see it for ourselves.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.300
First we have a question mark, then.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.880
First name "fake".

01:49.960 --> 01:51.130
That's exactly what we entered.

01:51.130 --> 01:53.450
We have last name "man".

01:54.070 --> 01:55.240
Email is 

01:55.240 --> 01:57.010
"fake something something gmail dot com"

01:59.590 --> 02:01.360
password "123". Uh oh

02:01.480 --> 02:11.810
They know our password, birthday, gender, and Cat "on". we didn't, didn't select "volvo".

02:11.890 --> 02:13.820
Not sure why? I'll take a look at that later.

02:14.140 --> 02:22.450
But, you can see over here, that the values that we entered, into our form were just attached

02:22.780 --> 02:23.700
to this link.

02:23.980 --> 02:27.090
And this is actually called query strings and what it is.

02:27.100 --> 02:34.540
It's one way for us, to send our information to the backend or the servers, beca use we have to store this

02:34.780 --> 02:40.520
form information somewhere, so that when we come back onto this page, the Web site remembers us.

02:40.840 --> 02:51.620
This was automatically generated in HTML5, with a form. But form was using an attribute called

02:51.860 --> 02:54.200
"GET" and this "GET".

02:54.380 --> 03:01.670
If I left it as this, will do the exact same thing, where it will attach the form information to the URL

03:01.670 --> 03:04.300
and send it to the server.

03:04.310 --> 03:11.810
There is another option, where you can do "POST" and you can try it on your own here, but you wouldn't

03:11.990 --> 03:14.290
see any query parameters.

03:14.450 --> 03:20.450
So this wouldn't change, the bar at the top won't change and that is because, it will be attached to the

03:20.450 --> 03:24.710
body of the request, which we'll get into, when we get to that section.

03:24.710 --> 03:30.110
I don't want to confuse you too much, but you can see the difference here, of why we might want to use

03:30.110 --> 03:35.480
"POST" instead of "GET" because well, what if somebody was over my shoulder and they can see my password

03:35.480 --> 03:36.980
right there in the bar.

03:36.980 --> 03:42.950
I just want you, to get comfortable with the idea that, we are sending this information to the backend

03:43.250 --> 03:44.850
the way we handle that.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.030
We'll get into, later on in the course.

03:47.030 --> 03:50.170
Right now, we're just focusing on the front end.

03:50.300 --> 03:57.830
The last thing I want to show you was, that form also has a "action" attribute, which used to get used a

03:57.830 --> 04:08.120
lot, if you saw old PHP based web sites, they will have, some sort of "action.php" which said, submit

04:08.120 --> 04:08.750
this form.

04:08.780 --> 04:17.380
And when you submit this form, to the backend, to the server, run this script this file, that's on the server.

04:17.570 --> 04:21.530
But there are better ways of doing this now, so I'll show that later on

04:21.530 --> 04:22.100
in the course

04:25.780 --> 04:29.240
let's, take a look at this.

04:29.320 --> 04:35.500
So we have a question mark and this is the standard, Any time there's a query string, so we're adding

04:35.500 --> 04:39.210
a piece of data to our URL.

04:39.400 --> 04:45.820
It starts off, with a question mark which states, Hey! coming up, we're going to have a bunch of data for

04:45.820 --> 04:46.490
you.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.750
The first one is "firstname", which again corresponds with the name, that we have in our form.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.330
And that was equal to "fake".

04:55.440 --> 04:58.450
So that's "property" and "value".

04:58.780 --> 05:10.440
So, you can think of "name" as "property" and the "value" as "man" so, 'lastname' 'firstname', you can see here, that

05:10.440 --> 05:11.580
there's an "&" sign.

05:11.580 --> 05:16.980
So that's again saying, 'firstname' equals to 'fake' and 'lastname' equals to 'man'.

05:17.130 --> 05:20.200
And 'email' equals to 'fake some jibberish.

05:20.340 --> 05:21.290
Gmail dot com'.

05:21.450 --> 05:25.130
So this is because of something called the URL encoding.

05:25.380 --> 05:33.990
And because the URL has special meaning for some characters, such as this and the 'questionmark'. It encodes

05:34.230 --> 05:40.670
the "@" sign with something, that it understands but it won't affect its encoding.

05:41.460 --> 05:52.170
We have 'password' '123', 'birthday', 'gender' 'on' and 'cat' 'on' and I've actually realized, why the 'volvo' and 'audi'

05:52.230 --> 05:58.530
information didn't register and that is because for the query string to work, as you can see it needs

05:58.530 --> 06:03.540
to have a name associated with the value, so we have 'firstname' and 'fake'.

06:03.540 --> 06:11.840
If we look at the radio buttons, we have a 'name' which is 'gender' and we have 'on'

06:11.850 --> 06:17.730
So you see over here, how we didn't send, any value.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.570
We know that the gender, some button was clicked, and the gender.

06:21.600 --> 06:30.920
So it's on, but we don't know, which value and that is because, we should have included a "value" for the

06:30.920 --> 06:37.250
"male" so that, if that's the one that is selected, a 'value' will be sent.

06:37.340 --> 06:50.780
And finally value and now same with the select. We should have had our "name" of the select field, the "cars"

06:51.940 --> 06:56.790
so that now the "name", can be associated with the value.

06:56.830 --> 06:59.470
So let's give that a try, one more time.

06:59.470 --> 07:01.710
I'm going to delete this.

07:01.830 --> 07:04.640
I'm going to save, the changes that we just made.

07:05.130 --> 07:12.030
I am going to make this full screen, let's refresh and enter some new information.

07:12.120 --> 07:22.950
'Fake', 'new', e-mail is 'newfake@gmail.com', password is '1234' this time.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.000
Birthday.

07:25.080 --> 07:36.850
Let's do 'female', 'dog' and 'audi' and then I click "Register!". And let's see, what we have here.

07:36.950 --> 07:46.280
We have 'firstname' 'fake', 'lastname' is 'new', 'email' 'newfake@gmail.com', 'password' '1234', 'birthday', 'gender' is

07:46.280 --> 07:47.350
'female'.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.130
Good. 'dog' is 'on'.

07:49.130 --> 07:49.410
OK.

07:49.430 --> 07:51.140
So we've selected dog, that's great.

07:51.140 --> 07:53.560
And then cars is 'audi'.

07:53.570 --> 07:54.240
There you go.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.510
And that's as complicated, as forms are going to get.

08:00.540 --> 08:06.300
You'll encounter this a lot and there is definitely in most websites, that you build whether it's a landing

08:06.300 --> 08:10.820
page, a Web site that requires registration.

08:10.890 --> 08:16.020
This is something that, you'll see a lot. Once you understand this, once it makes sense.

08:16.550 --> 08:19.090
You know, you can call yourself an HTML developer.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.240
So I'll see you in the next one.

08:21.500 --> 08:21.770
Bye bye
