Hello! This is your new robot friend and I have a fun little challenge for you.

00:06.810 --> 00:10.230
I've created this robot that is actually pretty cool.

00:10.230 --> 00:18.310
So as you hover, his head grows big and he can also dance:

00:18.310 --> 00:23.720
Now here's the challenge: I've created the majority of this robot.

00:23.730 --> 00:27.360
But you first need to assemble it, so it looks like this.

00:27.820 --> 00:35.030
And in the next section I've left a few files for you: an index file and the CSS file.

00:35.140 --> 00:42.430
The only problem is that these parts are all over the page and I need you to assemble them, so that you

00:42.430 --> 00:44.190
can have a robot friend as well.

00:44.230 --> 00:51.100
In the following section after the exercise I'll have the solution, that you can use, but give it a try

00:51.670 --> 00:54.660
and hopefully you'll have a new robot friend too.
