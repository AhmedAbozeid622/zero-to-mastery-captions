Welcome back, in this section, we're going to be talking about some advanced topics in CSS and I'm going

00:06.610 --> 00:09.930
to start off with the critical render path.

00:10.000 --> 00:10.800
What is that?

00:11.720 --> 00:17.540
Well, we always should know how things work underneath the hood so we can make our websites as fast

00:17.570 --> 00:19.950
and reliable as possible.

00:19.970 --> 00:25.410
So based on what we've built in the previous section, let's look at what's happening underneath the hood.

00:25.520 --> 00:31.760
We are going to our website and ideally our website will be on a server and I'll show you how to do

00:31.760 --> 00:33.500
that later on in the course.

00:33.620 --> 00:41.660
For now it's just our computer. But let's pretend we have a server, where our files are hosted. When we go

00:41.660 --> 00:42.620
to our website.

00:42.650 --> 00:45.160
We'll call it "coolwebsite.com".

00:45.290 --> 00:54.150
We will request the HTML file and the browser now sees our HTML file.

00:54.270 --> 01:02.730
So it reads through this document and as it's looking through it notices that 'Oh I need a CSS file

01:02.730 --> 01:03.230
here'.

01:04.210 --> 01:11.040
So it goes back, makes another request and says 'Hey, can you please give me a CSS file as well?'

01:11.850 --> 01:13.760
The server says 'Yep, no problem.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.690
Let me grab that for you.'

01:15.690 --> 01:27.560
Grabs the CSS file and now it starts looking at both: the HTML and the CSS file to try and figure out

01:27.620 --> 01:30.000
how the web page should look.

01:30.170 --> 01:34.000
But then it also notices that - 'Hold on a second.

01:34.070 --> 01:36.090
I need some fonts as well.'

01:36.320 --> 01:39.980
So it goes to this address and looks for font again.

01:40.430 --> 01:45.420
The website now asks the website that the fonts are hosted at.

01:45.440 --> 01:53.950
In our case it's the Google API and it grabs the font file. Now here's the thing.

01:54.170 --> 02:02.110
While it's grabbing the font file it could render the page and rendering means displaying the website,

02:03.590 --> 02:05.800
so it could display the website.

02:05.810 --> 02:13.970
If it only has the HTML or CSS but it might not show up the text, because the text is looking for the

02:13.970 --> 02:16.000
font file.

02:16.090 --> 02:22.930
So when we talk about the critical render path we like to mention that CSS is a render blocking file

02:22.930 --> 02:30.520
so you won't be able to render a web page until you receive your CSS and sometimes, if you have font

02:30.520 --> 02:36.460
files, you'll also have to wait for the text to render on the page.

02:36.630 --> 02:41.460
So keep that in mind when you build your websites. But what are some things that we can consider when

02:41.670 --> 02:44.900
doing this, so that our websites load up faster?

02:44.970 --> 02:47.580
One is maybe to have our own font files.

02:47.700 --> 02:54.420
Another one might be, that you don't want to make your CSS too big if we had hundreds and hundreds

02:54.420 --> 02:56.250
of lines of code of CSS.

02:56.490 --> 03:01.620
Well the file gets bigger and bigger and it's more and more that you have to transfer over the wire.

03:03.240 --> 03:09.950
One method that people have used and you'll see often is something, called 'minifying' your CSS. And

03:09.950 --> 03:12.080
if we open up the browser here.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.050
"Good morning!"

03:13.070 --> 03:15.320
Yeah, it's early in the morning that I'm filming this!

03:16.730 --> 03:23.660
And CSS Minifier. What it does is, you can enter your CSS here - you can see an example over here.

03:23.660 --> 03:28.070
So you enter this and you click 'Minify'.

03:28.310 --> 03:33.890
And what Minify does - it removes all the whitespace so everything is on one line,

03:33.890 --> 03:36.060
just really tiny together.

03:36.080 --> 03:43.040
So even though it's the same CSS, it technically makes the file a little bit smaller so that the

03:43.130 --> 03:50.030
number of bytes that you're sending over the Internet is a lot less and you'll see that technique used

03:50.030 --> 03:51.350
in Javascript as well.

03:51.350 --> 03:57.620
And we'll talk about that in that section. That is the critical render path, a path that a website

03:57.620 --> 04:03.300
takes to display something to the user. I'll see you in the next one.

04:03.330 --> 04:03.810
Bye-bye
