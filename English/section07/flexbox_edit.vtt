00:01.270 --> 00:06.480
Hello! Let's build a fun image portfolio site.

00:06.480 --> 00:12.660
One of the biggest problems that people have and the hardest problem with CSS - is always making sure

00:12.660 --> 00:17.550
that we have our items displayed in the location that we want.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.530
That is a really really difficult problem.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.070
And there are many many solutions to this problem.

00:22.200 --> 00:29.880
One of the new ways and now it's probably the most popular way is called Flexbox. And we're going to be

00:29.880 --> 00:34.960
using that to create a beautiful image website.

00:35.130 --> 00:36.180
Let's get started.

00:36.600 --> 00:44.700
So I have an 'index.html' file here and a 'style.css' file in the same directory on my desktop.

00:44.750 --> 00:50.760
So let's get started with our typical HTML file. I'm gonna title it CSS.

00:51.080 --> 01:01.460
And in the body we're going to have a header of 'Life in the Wild' and refresh.

01:01.460 --> 01:02.760
Perfect.

01:02.860 --> 01:14.350
And in here we're going to have a 'div' where that class of 'container'. Close that off and in here let's

01:14.360 --> 01:16.100
add some images.

01:16.100 --> 01:21.710
Now, if you remember, with images I can type in this and then 'Tab' with Sublime Text.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.210
And we don't have any pictures yet.

01:23.210 --> 01:28.280
So for now let's just copy and paste and add 6 images

01:31.060 --> 01:32.490
Save and refresh.

01:32.510 --> 01:41.170
OK! Let's start adding some of these images and I actually have a file full of these images for you and I'll

01:41.170 --> 01:44.880
attach it to the next lesson so you can also build it yourself.

01:44.890 --> 01:47.140
So I'm just going to copy these quickly.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.530
There is a lot of copy and pasting.

02:01.530 --> 02:04.670
Let's save that and refresh. All right.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.530
We have our images and they're massive.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.200
So let's make this a little bit smaller.

02:11.290 --> 02:21.730
We can now go to our style-sheet and we can select the images and let's just do 'width:450px;' and 'height:

02:22.690 --> 02:30.070
300px;' and you might be asking yourself 'How can we don't do it here - on the individual images?'

02:30.070 --> 02:36.490
Remember: we can add attributes, but that means if we needed to ever change anything we have to individually

02:36.490 --> 02:41.110
go into each image and change it versus just changing in one location.

02:41.110 --> 02:44.640
So for now we're going to stick to the CSS size.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.820
Let's save that and refresh.

02:46.820 --> 02:53.980
And obviously we need to link the file so let's add a link here and it will reference our 'style.CSS'.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.960
Save that and refresh.

02:56.980 --> 02:57.620
There you go!

02:57.640 --> 03:02.910
We have our images look at that - some beautiful animals here. Now

03:03.100 --> 03:05.600
Flexbox has a great resource.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.810
Obviously from CSS tricks.

03:11.060 --> 03:14.690
And this is pretty much all you need.

03:14.690 --> 03:20.300
It shows you all the things that Flexbox can do and as you can see it allows you to play around with

03:20.720 --> 03:23.900
content and shift it around in a very nice way.

03:25.590 --> 03:30.970
I'm going to attach this link for you at the end of this video and you can take a look for yourself. For now,


03:31.280 --> 03:42.130
Let's learn a few Flexbox properties. We want to define that everything inside of this 'div' is part of

03:42.130 --> 03:42.690
Flexbox.

03:42.710 --> 03:44.690
Let's select it's called 'container'.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.490
So let's do the 'container'.

03:47.770 --> 03:53.660
And within this 'container' we will say that 'display' will be 'flex'.

03:53.710 --> 03:57.330
So that's how we activate Flexbox. Refresh.

03:57.590 --> 04:02.990
OK, we have a few changes which is nice but I don't want to scroll through this.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.470
Ideally I can see everything without scrolling.

04:05.710 --> 04:12.970
So one thing we want to do and again we can look down over here, at the suggestion we see the 'flex-wrap'

04:13.060 --> 04:22.160
might be something that we want to add. So let's do 'flex-wrap' and do 'wrap' and refresh.

04:22.430 --> 04:29.310
Okay, that's perfect! So if I make this bigger you see that everything is wrapping around. OK.

04:29.680 --> 04:34.770
But I think the content should be centered. It kind of looks weird to having everything to the left

04:34.850 --> 04:35.420
here.

04:35.470 --> 04:43.680
So again we can do something called 'justify-content' and then we can do 'center'. And refresh.

04:43.820 --> 04:51.110
Perfect! And if we look on the guide over hear, 'justify-content' should be right over here. You

04:51.110 --> 04:56.000
can see all the properties that it has. Now that looks pretty good.

04:55.990 --> 04:58.380
And we did that pretty fast.

04:58.630 --> 05:00.870
Made a nice little portfolio website already.

05:00.880 --> 05:09.030
What else can we add. Now that we have this flexible container around our website.

05:09.100 --> 05:18.360
Let's make the header a little bit prettier than it is now so that's the 'h1'. We can add 'h1' here and

05:18.360 --> 05:21.510
we'll say that the 'font-family' is... 

05:21.540 --> 05:22.260
I like this one [fantasy].

05:22.400 --> 05:25.280
Let's save and refresh.

05:25.690 --> 05:28.020
Oh, I like that one. 'font-size',

05:28.050 --> 05:30.810
let's make it a little bit bigger.

05:30.810 --> 05:34.620
We'll do '3em'.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.340
So if you don't remember what 'em' is.

05:36.340 --> 05:38.480
Make sure you check out the video.

05:38.650 --> 05:38.860
OK.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.710
So that looks better.

05:40.720 --> 05:46.150
Maybe it'll be nice to have a bit of a border as well. So we can do 'border-bottom' because we only want

05:46.150 --> 05:55.660
a border on the bottom and we'll do '2px solid pink' and refresh. OK.

05:55.820 --> 05:56.950
Perfect.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.790
That looks good but ideally I want a border just around this I don't want that in our section, so we can

06:01.790 --> 06:10.520
actually just say that for 'h1', we want the 'width' to be '400px'. I save and refresh.

06:10.540 --> 06:10.970
All right.

06:10.970 --> 06:11.990
Perfect.

06:11.990 --> 06:13.250
That looks good.

06:13.370 --> 06:21.560
And ideally this is centered so that the line underneath is well on the left side and right side is

06:21.590 --> 06:22.950
equally distributed.

06:23.800 --> 06:30.010
So again use something like 'text-align: center;'

06:32.830 --> 06:38.430
and you'll notice here that it's aligned in the center but not the web page center.

06:38.440 --> 06:44.370
It's aligned in the center of the width of 400px but that looks good.

06:44.400 --> 06:53.680
It will be actually nice to have a border on here as well so let's add the 'border-right: 2px solid pink;'

06:54.550 --> 06:56.180
save and refresh.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.520
All right.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.210
That looks very nice.

07:00.290 --> 07:05.330
And then the final thing I want add is I want to have some spacing between these images so I'm going

07:05.330 --> 07:11.090
to add a 'margin:10px;' here and refresh.

07:11.140 --> 07:11.910
All right.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.050
Let's take a look at our website right now

07:18.790 --> 07:20.580
That looks very very nice.

07:20.870 --> 07:28.520
As you can see, Flexbox is a very easy thing to implement and it makes your websites look really really

07:28.520 --> 07:35.320
nice and you can position your content very easily, especially if you have these container like structures.

07:35.390 --> 07:38.610
I want to show you one last resource for Flexbox.

07:38.620 --> 07:44.990
Again, this is a tool that you will see more and more of. And ideally you will build web sites using Flexbox

07:45.470 --> 07:47.760
instead of some of the older ways.

07:47.840 --> 07:54.550
One way to get really really good at Flexbox is to play this game and it's called a 'Flexbox Froggy'

07:54.620 --> 07:55.520
I believe.

07:55.610 --> 08:02.700
Let's see. And here you're trying to get the frog onto the leaf.

08:02.700 --> 08:13.370
This little home, so you can do something like 'justify-content: flex-end' and look at that! You get the

08:13.370 --> 08:17.540
frog onto the leaf and you move on to the next round.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.230
I'll leave this for you.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.740
It's a really really good way to learn Flexbox.

08:21.740 --> 08:26.430
I think this is probably the best way to do layout and CSS.

08:26.630 --> 08:28.360
I'll see you in the next one.
Bye-bye
