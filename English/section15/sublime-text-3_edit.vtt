00:01.670 --> 00:07.520
As a developer, a developer environment is really important. Since you'll be spending a lot of time in

00:07.520 --> 00:08.740
front of the computer

00:08.870 --> 00:11.870
you want to make sure everything is set up properly.

00:12.230 --> 00:18.320
In this video, we are going to go over how to set up your developer environment and I'll show you what

00:18.320 --> 00:20.130
I use on my laptop.

00:20.350 --> 00:27.400
Now since I'm using a Mac I will leave notes after this video for Windows users as well.

00:28.260 --> 00:33.480
Finally this video is completely optional and actually this entire section is optional.

00:33.480 --> 00:38.900
If you are looking to customize your setup or you already have it done then you can skip over this

00:38.900 --> 00:40.950
section and move onto the next one.

00:40.950 --> 00:45.870
Now let's get started. In this video we're going to customize Sublime Text.

00:46.010 --> 00:52.470
I mean Sublime Text looks pretty nice and I have a sample project, actually our background generator here.

00:52.560 --> 00:55.530
You know, it's - it's kind of plain and boring.

00:55.590 --> 01:01.080
I want to show you that if you go to 'Sublime Text' to 'Preferences', you can actually choose some color

01:01.080 --> 01:05.650
schemes and themes. So 'Theme...' for example, you see that we only have two right now.

01:06.240 --> 01:15.180
I can change to that. I can change the color scheme to this and we get a bit of a change. But the one

01:15.180 --> 01:20.520
that I really really like is the material theme. And I'll leave the link to this for you and you can

01:20.520 --> 01:24.680
see over here that it makes your Sublime Text look really really nice.

01:25.900 --> 01:31.570
If I go over this, we see that we can just install it with something called package control. And the way

01:31.570 --> 01:38.200
we do that and it actually gives you pretty nice instructions, is we just need to press 'CMD' or in case of

01:38.200 --> 01:40.410
Windows, 'Ctrl' and 'P' ('CMD-P').

01:40.510 --> 01:41.570
So let's do that.

01:41.620 --> 01:43.280
I'm going to say 'Command + P ('CMD-Shift-P')'

01:43.320 --> 01:51.140
And I see over here 'Install Packages' so I can actually start typing and I'll get 'Install Packages'.

01:51.490 --> 01:57.860
Or if you don't have package control you can actually install 'Package Control' through here as well.

01:57.930 --> 02:06.440
So let's install packages and let's see what it says over here. And enter search for 'Material Theme'.

02:06.570 --> 02:06.950
OK.

02:07.050 --> 02:11.570
So we'll just say 'Material Theme', and there it is.

02:11.590 --> 02:17.560
And you're just gonna click on it, you'll see that down here it's doing a bit of work to download it.

02:17.560 --> 02:22.120
And once it's done installing, we should have - there you go!

02:22.310 --> 02:28.820
We've installed it and it says to activate theme, well, it actually gives you really nice instructions again.

02:28.820 --> 02:34.250
It's actually a really good idea to close and reopen Sublime Text, just to make sure everything is running

02:34.250 --> 02:36.440
smoothly. So I'm going to close.

02:36.950 --> 02:39.420
And let's just reopen it.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.360
And all you have to do now is just go to 'Preferences', 'Theme' and look at that.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.050
We have our 'Material Theme'.

02:47.170 --> 02:52.060
So I like the - you know what, I like the

02:54.960 --> 02:58.860
darker ones, so we'll do - let's do the default one.

02:58.860 --> 02:59.640
There you go.

02:59.910 --> 03:00.160
OK.

03:00.190 --> 03:01.140
We're getting there.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.400
Let's check out what else it says over here.

03:03.480 --> 03:08.120
So we've changed it to Material Theme.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.530
And if you go to 'Color Schemes' as well now,

03:13.510 --> 03:15.410
you should have a Material Theme as well.

03:15.410 --> 03:18.800
So we'll make sure that those match - all the same Material theme.

03:18.930 --> 03:19.710
Look at that.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.350
That looks pretty nice.

03:21.380 --> 03:24.350
So we have our script file looking nice.

03:24.500 --> 03:29.460
And also our CSS looking nice.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.110
Okay, Awesome.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.460
Let's see what else we can do with this theme.

03:31.460 --> 03:37.480
The other thing is you have a couple of Addons, you can actually add file icons if you want.

03:37.490 --> 03:44.270
You can see over here that you can add these, so let's see how we can install this.

03:44.370 --> 03:49.910
We can just do Package Control: Install Package and Find A File Icon. Let's do that.

03:50.040 --> 03:58.850
And then again do 'CMD-Shit-P': 'install package' and let's do 'file icon'.

03:58.880 --> 04:04.360
And there you go. "Please restart Sublime Text for the applied icons to take effect."

04:04.480 --> 04:05.600
But it looks like it already has.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.250
Look at that.

04:06.340 --> 04:12.200
You can see over here I have the HTML5 icon, JavaScript icon, and then CSS3 icon.

04:12.250 --> 04:13.790
That looks pretty cool.

04:14.020 --> 04:14.390
Awesome.

04:14.500 --> 04:23.680
I'm going to close that. Let's go back to Material Theme. And they have recommended settings for a better

04:23.680 --> 04:24.340
experience.

04:24.340 --> 04:28.420
I'm actually just going to copy this. Where do you want to put this? well..

04:30.320 --> 04:40.310
If you go into 'Sublime Text', 'Preferences', and you go into 'Settings'. You'll get 'Default Settings' on the

04:40.310 --> 04:44.870
left hand side. And on the right hand side, you have the user settings and you want to make most of your

04:44.870 --> 04:46.010
changes on this side,

04:46.190 --> 04:50.570
You see that our theme has already been automatically changed to Material.

04:50.600 --> 04:59.740
So here we can just add our copy and pasted suggested theme options. Let's save that. Some of the themes

04:59.740 --> 05:01.300
have changed.

05:01.300 --> 05:01.770
Awesome.

05:01.790 --> 05:06.560
I'm going to close this and, all right, things are looking a little bit nicer.

05:07.620 --> 05:08.790
What else can we do here?

05:08.940 --> 05:12.360
You can actually also change the fonts.

05:12.720 --> 05:18.720
If I download something like 'Roboto_Mono' which is a Google font if you remember we just have to click

05:18.720 --> 05:23.160
the plus icon, we'll download it.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.200
And once we open that, there we go, we have our font.

05:34.510 --> 05:41.320
And what you do is you actually grab this and drag it into your application which is usually even on

05:41.320 --> 05:43.840
Windows you'll have a font app.

05:43.840 --> 05:49.810
On Mac, we have the font book right here and all we do is just drag it in here.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.300
So I have 'Roboto_Mono' now as my font

05:51.310 --> 06:04.750
and it's actually very easy to change if I go into my 'Settings' again,

06:04.750 --> 06:05.530
and we can just say "font_face",

06:09.260 --> 06:18.510
and we'll do "Roboto Mono", we save that.

06:18.540 --> 06:19.210
There you go.

06:19.320 --> 06:24.640
We've changed our font - looks even nicer.

06:24.680 --> 06:29.410
And one last thing that I really like doing is changing the Color Scheme.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.990
There is something called 'oceanic next', that's really really nice.

06:43.470 --> 06:48.720
And as you can see, this is completely up to you. If you want to have your own little

06:48.720 --> 06:49.010
color scheme and theme,

06:49.020 --> 06:50.100
you can do that yourself.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.410
But again I just want to show you my set up here.

06:52.530 --> 06:54.950
So 'Package Control', oceanic next.

06:54.990 --> 07:06.090
Again, we just simply do 'CMD-Shift-P', install package, ''oceanic next' color scheme, press enter.

07:06.200 --> 07:13.300
And now if I go to 'Sublime Text', 'Preferences', 'Color Scheme', I should have 'Oceanic Next'.

07:14.850 --> 07:18.840
And there you go.

07:18.860 --> 07:24.110
I personally like this color style. If you like something else, well, that works too.

07:24.110 --> 07:24.960
Very cool.

07:24.960 --> 07:30.750
And the last thing I want to show you is that besides just looks, you can install packages with Sublime

07:31.460 --> 07:33.110
and if you just go to 'sublime packages',

07:35.680 --> 07:45.400
you can do a lot of things. You can add a lot of extensions to Sublime Text 

07:45.540 --> 07:46.790
anything that you need.

07:46.800 --> 07:53.010
For us, I think the most important thing is that, again we do 'install package' and the first one is called

07:53.010 --> 07:53.900
'Babel'.

07:54.420 --> 08:00.560
And as you can see it's a syntax definitions for ES6 JavaScript with React JSX extensions.

08:01.050 --> 08:01.620
Whoa, what does that mean?

08:01.620 --> 08:07.560
Well, again as new features of JavaScript come up, we want to make sure that Sublime Text recognizes it

08:07.590 --> 08:10.650
and adds all the colors and formatting that we need.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.880
Well by having 'Babel' and we installed this, we now have

08:18.050 --> 08:19.790
a 'Babel' file format.

08:19.970 --> 08:22.820
So if I actually click on this, instead of the JavaScript one

08:27.280 --> 08:35.210
you can do some really nice things like 'Arrow functions' and all recognize it. I recommend using the

08:35.210 --> 08:41.280
JavaScript Babel version to make sure that any new JavaScript features that you'll use will be nicely highlighted.

08:41.300 --> 08:47.610
One other one actually that I'll show you is the 'sidebar'.

08:47.830 --> 08:53.620
I've got to install package and then 'Sidebar Enhancements'.

08:53.620 --> 08:54.310
Up until now - if I right click here,

08:54.310 --> 09:03.810
I have only a few options; Rename, Delete File, or Reveal in Finder. If I add 'Sidebar Enhancements',

09:03.810 --> 09:10.490
and now I go right click I have way more options that I can do with my files which is very very cool.

09:10.620 --> 09:11.010
All right.

09:11.010 --> 09:11.420
That's it.

09:11.430 --> 09:17.160
Play around with your settings and you can read up a ton on the Internet about everybody's customized

09:17.160 --> 09:18.320
way of doing things.

09:18.510 --> 09:20.870
I think this works really really well.

09:20.880 --> 09:26.670
It looks pretty and it makes your life a whole lot easier when writing new JavaScript syntax.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.440
I'll see you in the next one. Bye bye
