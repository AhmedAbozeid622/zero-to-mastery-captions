00:01.360 --> 00:06.870
In this video we're going to talk about how to contribute to open source and actually take you through

00:06.870 --> 00:07.740
the steps.

00:07.910 --> 00:15.580
But first for those of you who don't know what is open source, well, a lot of technology that have created

00:15.580 --> 00:22.300
the Internet that we know it today has been built on top of open source projects and open source projects

00:22.390 --> 00:24.750
means that anybody can view the code.

00:24.910 --> 00:32.830
Anybody can see the code of a program, can inspect it, can modify it, can enhance it. In this way, the idea

00:32.830 --> 00:40.660
is that by sharing this information with everybody we get everybody's input and we use the collective

00:40.900 --> 00:47.400
mind to improve software. Not only that it's also benefits everybody.

00:47.500 --> 00:54.580
For example, the most famous open source project, Linux is an operating system just like Windows or MacOS

00:54.610 --> 01:00.130
except it's built by everyday people.

01:00.130 --> 01:02.470
It's code, it's completely open source.

01:02.470 --> 01:09.370
Anybody can inspect it and add on to it. And it's become so successful that most of the cloud that we

01:09.370 --> 01:13.360
know with most servers usually run Linux.

01:13.360 --> 01:18.850
So not only do you get to work with other developers from around the world you can build great projects

01:18.850 --> 01:24.310
by just working in teams and learning how open source works and you don't have to create something as

01:24.310 --> 01:25.870
big as an operating system.

01:25.990 --> 01:32.440
Finally, a lot of employers look upon open source contribution as a plus. If you're able to put in your

01:32.440 --> 01:34.910
resume that you're an open source contributor, 

01:35.080 --> 01:36.510
well, that's a good sign.

01:36.670 --> 01:42.030
Plus it teaches you valuable skills using git and github to working teams.

01:42.040 --> 01:46.110
So let's show you how to make your first Open-Source contribution.

01:46.450 --> 01:49.960
Let's go to the zero to mastery organization here on github.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.930
This was created as a practice ground for you, a playground.

01:55.210 --> 02:02.380
Nobody will yell at you if you break things. You can contribute, add silly things whatever you want.

02:02.380 --> 02:03.420
It's a testing ground.

02:03.460 --> 02:05.830
So you have as much fun as possible.

02:06.040 --> 02:13.310
And we have a great community of administrators that will help you with these open source projects.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.840
By the way who are these administrators?

02:16.850 --> 02:23.540
Just want to give a shout out to them. They are fellow students that have been kind enough to dedicate their

02:23.540 --> 02:28.320
time maintaining some of our open source projects so you can say hi to them.

02:28.370 --> 02:30.720
They're very very active on slack as well.

02:30.800 --> 02:36.980
But any time you make a pull request or contribute to open source you're most likely going to be communicating

02:37.100 --> 02:38.250
with at least one of them.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.670
So hello to all of you.

02:41.880 --> 02:42.390
All right.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.880
Let's look at how to make your very first Open-Source contribution.

02:46.080 --> 02:52.650
And by the way it's not limited to just this. Once you contribute here you can go off and contribute

02:52.650 --> 02:55.260
to other open source projects all over github.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.030
There are so many to pick from.

02:57.060 --> 02:58.700
You can just pick whichever one you want.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.240
Or you can stick to these ones and make them better and better.

03:02.250 --> 03:07.220
We definitely have a great community of developers and we can create some awesome projects together.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.940
Now the way you want to get started.

03:09.950 --> 03:14.370
Well luckily for you there's actually a start-here-guidelines.

03:14.430 --> 03:21.920
So if I click on this, you have a step by step instruction on what to do.

03:21.970 --> 03:26.830
The first thing you want to do is actually read about the anatomy of an open source project but also

03:26.980 --> 03:32.640
check out that get started guide by our wonderful fellow student that contributed her time and she's

03:32.650 --> 03:34.620
actually an admin as well.

03:34.670 --> 03:41.740
And created this beautiful guide for you to follow step by step instructions on how to contribute.

03:41.980 --> 03:44.710
So after this video definitely check out this document.

03:44.770 --> 03:49.190
But I'm going to skip over this and get to the part where we start contributing.

03:50.110 --> 03:50.650
All right.

03:50.740 --> 03:58.270
So the first thing we want to do is we want to find out which projects you can join by clicking on this

03:58.540 --> 03:59.740
Google sheet over here.

03:59.770 --> 04:02.380
We see all the projects that we have.

04:02.530 --> 04:06.340
And at the bottom tab these are the projects that you can sign up for.

04:06.490 --> 04:10.380
So in my case let's say I want to contribute to the travel guide.

04:10.690 --> 04:13.610
I'm going to enter my github username here.

04:13.630 --> 04:18.840
In my case, it'll be, this handle and that's it.

04:18.850 --> 04:23.270
And the admins are going to look at that and add you to the project.

04:24.440 --> 04:24.850
Alright.

04:24.910 --> 04:34.720
So once we've selected that- once we've selected which project we want to join, and by the way these projects

04:34.750 --> 04:38.760
you can also visit in the 'Zero To Mastery' Web site.

04:38.830 --> 04:42.840
You can see over here that the 'travel-guide' has all this information,

04:42.880 --> 04:48.310
but when we click on it well there's not much happening here so you want to start the ball rolling so

04:48.310 --> 04:53.360
others can contribute and contribute, and eventually have a finished application.

04:53.630 --> 04:53.860
Alright, so

04:53.860 --> 04:55.540
that's the first step.

04:55.540 --> 05:00.170
Let's look at the second step that we have and we want to sign up for the project you'd like to

05:00.170 --> 05:07.030
contribute to and you can sign up with the Google form, again created by our administrators.

05:07.150 --> 05:10.480
And in my case I want to sign up for the travel guide.

05:10.620 --> 05:18.560
And again my github name is this and I should provide my Slack user name as well.

05:21.060 --> 05:21.900
I'll submit, there you go.

05:24.730 --> 05:28.710
We've submitted this so that the administrators are notified.

05:28.930 --> 05:30.700
And then finally if we go back

05:34.190 --> 05:36.920
we go back to the 'start here guidelines'.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.280
Step three is done.

05:38.450 --> 05:44.780
Step four is to make our very first pull request and I'm not going to bore you. I've given you resources here.

05:44.890 --> 05:45.600
But this video, I'm going to

05:45.760 --> 05:48.750
show you exactly how to do your very first pull request.

05:48.950 --> 05:55.610
And what we're going to do is in the 'start here guidelines', we have a contributors file and this contributors file

05:55.610 --> 06:02.150
has all the people that have submitted pull requests and want to be part of this organization.

06:02.150 --> 06:04.770
You see that our list is getting pretty pretty big.

06:05.730 --> 06:12.270
So the way we do this, first thing we want to do is we want to click on this 'Fork' and 'Fork' means you

06:12.270 --> 06:15.660
want to copy this project so it shows up in your github profile.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.240
So I'm going to fork.

06:17.760 --> 06:22.320
It's -it'll ask you where you should fork, you want to fork it to your own personal place.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.610
It's going to copy the project and forking from 'zero to mastery start here guidelines'.

06:26.650 --> 06:28.860
all the way into yours.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.960
So you see that now it's your

06:30.960 --> 06:31.460
username / start here guidelines 

06:31.460 --> 06:34.440
with the little fork sign over here.

06:34.440 --> 06:41.070
Once you have that you click on clone and we want to clone and download this entire repo.

06:41.070 --> 06:47.350
So again I'm going to copy, go to my terminal and in my desktop, I'll just do 'git clone', again we should

06:47.370 --> 06:49.040
know how to do this by now.

06:49.380 --> 06:55.540
I'm going to clone the project so that this will be on my desktop.

06:55.560 --> 06:55.820
All right.

06:55.830 --> 06:56.520
Perfect.

06:56.520 --> 07:03.480
And now we can 'cd' into this project which is 'start here guidelines' and perfect.

07:03.480 --> 07:08.290
We have our folder with all our files.

07:08.370 --> 07:16.960
If I open sublime here I will have my 'start here guidelines' repo

07:17.190 --> 07:18.720
now on my computer.

07:19.110 --> 07:26.970
So in the 'start here guidelines' the number four step asks us to update the contributor's file to include

07:26.970 --> 07:35.790
your name so everybody should do this that goes to this course is at the bottom to add your name to

07:35.790 --> 07:37.980
the list of contributors.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.420
Now as we know, we don't want to work on master,

07:41.430 --> 07:42.560
We want our branch out.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.660
So we're going to 'git checkout'

07:45.690 --> 07:48.110
And this is the short way of creating a new branch,

07:48.120 --> 07:54.590
So we're going to checkout and create a new branch calling git -let's call it 'test' for now.

07:54.990 --> 07:55.320
All right.

07:55.320 --> 08:01.440
So we've created the 'test' branch, we're in the 'test' branch and in here we can create our changes.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.400
In our case, in the contributor's file at the very bottom

08:04.470 --> 08:10.510
we want to add our own github username as a contributor.

08:10.850 --> 08:14.850
In our case this is using markdown and in markdown.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.670
This is the syntax for it.

08:16.850 --> 08:23.450
We want to show the square brackets where we're going to display and then the normal brackets afterwards

08:23.480 --> 08:24.320
is the link.

08:24.320 --> 08:31.210
So this is going to be a clickable link with a link to my github profile.

08:31.210 --> 08:31.630
All right.

08:31.630 --> 08:37.260
So if I save this and go to '*git status'

08:37.320 --> 08:39.490
oops, 'git status' - if I can spell

08:39.850 --> 08:42.800
We see that the contributors file has been updated.

08:43.180 --> 08:49.650
I can -I'll just 'git add' and 'git commit' and I'll just say that this is a 'test'

08:52.580 --> 08:53.510
perfect.

08:53.510 --> 09:01.350
So one file has changed and now all we can do is 'git push origin' and we want to push it to

09:01.380 --> 09:01.830
our 'test' branch.

09:01.910 --> 09:06.520
So 'origin' means that we want to push to our forked repo.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.140
So that is right here,

09:09.140 --> 09:10.930
out forked repo,

09:11.120 --> 09:16.590
that is the 'origin'. And in here, I'm going to push to our 'test' branch.

09:16.640 --> 09:21.960
So that is the branch. We press Enter, perfect.

09:22.060 --> 09:25.560
Looks like our changes have been pushed. Let's clear this,

09:25.570 --> 09:30.670
so it's a little bit cleaner, and go back to the website and look at that.

09:30.790 --> 09:37.780
We see that 'test' is now up there and we can create a pull request.

09:37.820 --> 09:40.370
However there's one issue here right.

09:40.400 --> 09:49.390
If you look over here I just made a push to my forked version, but if I go to the actual 'start here guidelines'.

09:49.650 --> 09:54.960
So let's go to the 'start here guidelines' here.

09:55.110 --> 10:02.700
Look at that, I have myself who has just created a minute ago from a forked version a pull request.

10:02.700 --> 10:09.850
So if I click on 'compare and pull request', look down over here I see that I just added my name.

10:10.040 --> 10:19.560
I can now say "Just added myself to the list. Please let me in".

10:20.760 --> 10:23.840
And you can actually tag one of the admins here if you want.

10:23.850 --> 10:26.890
In my case I'm going to tag myself because I am an admin.

10:27.930 --> 10:34.080
Or -actually I'm not going to tag anybody since I'm here anyway- and I'm going to click 'Create pull request'

10:36.690 --> 10:47.850
And look at that, we now have a 'test' branch and this 'test' branch is now ready to merge into master 

10:47.850 --> 10:48.930
with my name here.

10:48.960 --> 10:58.360
So just to make sure that this works before I click merge I'll go into the 'zero to mastery',

10:58.360 --> 11:01.910
'start here guidelines' and look at the contributor's file.

11:02.110 --> 11:04.370
You see that my name's not at the bottom.

11:04.660 --> 11:12.310
But as soon as I hit 'Merge pull request' and this is something that only if you're an administrator.

11:12.310 --> 11:17.710
In my case I can do it so I can merge it myself, an administrator will merge it for you.

11:17.710 --> 11:23.940
They will click 'merge', 'confirm merge' and there you go.

11:23.990 --> 11:28.960
We are merged into master and I can delete the branch because we don't need it anymore.

11:28.970 --> 11:30.500
So this's good practice now.

11:31.550 --> 11:40.430
If I go now back to this and refresh, look at that, my name appears in the contributor's file in the

11:40.430 --> 11:45.630
'start here guidelines' on the 'zero to mastery'. Very cool.

11:45.800 --> 11:52.380
OK, so now that we know this, let's actually show you how to contribute to one of the open source projects.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.330
I'm going to back to 'zero to mastery'.

11:54.370 --> 11:58.040
And if you remember I signed up for the 'travel guide'

12:01.080 --> 12:03.090
and then the 'travel guide' over here,

12:03.120 --> 12:04.170
well, it has nothing.

12:04.170 --> 12:07.560
So I'm going to contribute an index.html file.

12:07.860 --> 12:14.200
I'm going to clone the repo - ooh, first I have to fork, remember? I'm going to fork.

12:17.690 --> 12:19.670
Perfect, I have it on my own branch.

12:20.500 --> 12:27.710
Now I can clone this repo onto my laptop, so I'm going to move out of the 'start here guidelines'.

12:27.730 --> 12:31.600
I'm going to 'git clone' the 'travel guide'

12:31.600 --> 12:32.420
Perfect.

12:32.590 --> 12:35.340
Let's go into the 'travel guide' now.

12:35.890 --> 12:38.730
And I'm on the master branch but I want to create a new branch.

12:38.740 --> 12:53.870
I'm going to say 'git checkout' and I'm going to say 'indexfile' branch. And within here I can now open sublime.

12:54.060 --> 13:03.140
And let's just add a simple index.html file. I'm going to say 'new file', 'index.html'

13:03.350 --> 13:13.340
And within here using my short key command, I'm going to say title will be 'travel guide' and I'll just enter a 

13:13.350 --> 13:23.670
simple header one tag that says 'trabel guide', with an exclamation mark because we're really excited to

13:23.670 --> 13:24.300
work on it.

13:25.150 --> 13:26.980
And I can't spell not 'trabel'

13:26.980 --> 13:28.690
It's 'travel' guide.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.460
All right.

13:29.530 --> 13:30.240
Perfect.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.690
I'd save that.

13:31.690 --> 13:33.030
Go back to github.

13:33.400 --> 13:40.480
If I go to 'git status' I can even do 'git diff' and this will show you the differences. In our case there's

13:40.480 --> 13:47.260
no diffs because we've just created the file. And I can just do 'git add', 'git commit'

13:50.010 --> 13:51.850
"adding index.html'

13:51.850 --> 13:57.540
And then finally 'git push origin'

13:57.860 --> 14:02.310
And then we can do 'indexfile'

14:02.330 --> 14:05.990
All right, if I click enter.

14:06.070 --> 14:06.730
All right.

14:06.740 --> 14:10.700
I've just created a new branch and sent it up to github.

14:10.880 --> 14:15.590
Let's see if I go back to github.

14:15.920 --> 14:19.780
I see that, yeah I have a new pull request which is great.

14:19.820 --> 14:23.110
Now what if I go back to the 'zero to mastery/travel guide'

14:25.610 --> 14:26.090
All right,

14:26.140 --> 14:31.410
I have it here as well. In my case, I'm not going to worry too much about my pull request,

14:31.410 --> 14:42.290
You can do this on your own. But for the 'zero to mastery organization', I'm going to say 

14:42.290 --> 14:43.420
'compare & pull request'

14:43.420 --> 14:46.320
I see that I've added the index file.

14:46.580 --> 14:51.630
I would notify somebody on the team like "hey, just adding index.html"

14:51.660 --> 14:59.390
"let me know what you think?". I'm going to 'create pull request'

14:59.510 --> 15:05.030
And by the way how nice is this? github says "Hey, be sure to review the code of conduct because we have

15:05.030 --> 15:09.740
a code of conduct file for open source" which I recommend that you read.

15:10.010 --> 15:14.080
But otherwise, let's create the pull request.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.750
And again I'm cheating here because I am an administrator on this.

15:17.790 --> 15:20.920
So I shouldn't merged my own pull request but in our case.

15:20.940 --> 15:22.530
I know that I did this right.

15:22.530 --> 15:30.920
I'm just trying to 'merge', 'confirm merge', 'delete branch' and check it out.

15:32.190 --> 15:36.500
Our 'travel guide', now has an index.html file.

15:36.630 --> 15:37.350
How cool is that.

15:37.350 --> 15:39.740
I just contributed to open source.

15:39.750 --> 15:43.600
So there are other projects in 'zero to mastery' that you can do this with.

15:43.640 --> 15:48.180
that don't have an index.html, so you can actually go ahead and do that now and start off the

15:48.180 --> 15:48.950
project.

15:48.960 --> 15:54.690
And as more and more people come on they can add on to this, add a CSS file, a javascript file and eventually

15:54.690 --> 16:00.640
have a nice beautiful travel guide. The one last thing I'm going to show you something quick that you can do

16:00.900 --> 16:03.900
Well, I want this to be used on github pages.

16:03.960 --> 16:12.270
I can just go to 'settings', scroll all the way down to github pages, select master branch as my

16:12.270 --> 16:18.580
github page, click save and if you scroll all the way down now, check it out.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.970
We have a link for our 'travel guide'

16:22.080 --> 16:31.440
So now again you can do this with all the new projects. You can edit the description and add a website.

16:31.480 --> 16:39.210
If I click save, check it out, 'travel guide' now has a website that we can use.

16:39.350 --> 16:44.090
So as people join into the project they can see what the latest master is.

16:44.120 --> 16:52.560
So as we add on to the project, newcomers can see how our travel guide is going. By the way you want to know

16:52.560 --> 16:53.750
something else that's cool

16:53.750 --> 17:02.300
by following these steps. Well, remember how we've created in the 'start here guidelines'? How we've added the

17:02.300 --> 17:03.520
contributors?

17:03.920 --> 17:11.150
Well if your name appears in the contributors, the admin will give you access as a contributor.

17:11.180 --> 17:18.430
And when you get that, well, in your profile, you'll have a cool little icon 'zero to mastery organization' icons 

17:18.490 --> 17:24.350
and you can have many of these and people that work at companies have logo of their company

17:24.350 --> 17:24.730
as well.

17:24.830 --> 17:32.070
But this way you get to have a cool little 'zero to mastery' icon created by one of our students. But that's

17:32.070 --> 17:32.870
it.

17:33.000 --> 17:41.280
That's open source. And I highly, highly recommend that you get involved.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.690
It's a great way to work with others.

17:43.700 --> 17:47.500
It's a great way to learn how git and github really work.

17:47.630 --> 17:50.420
But most importantly, we don't care if you break things.

17:50.420 --> 17:56.900
This is a fun little playground for you to practice so that when you are at a real company you know

17:56.900 --> 18:02.510
exactly what to do to make pull requests, to make merges and to create features.

18:02.510 --> 18:06.220
There's no doubt that there's a lot that an individual programmer can do.

18:06.410 --> 18:11.630
However, the progress in scale that something can be built is really compounded when many people work

18:11.630 --> 18:12.790
on something together.

18:13.930 --> 18:15.610
I can't recommend this enough for you.

18:15.820 --> 18:21.400
Go make your first Open-Source contribution and have fun building things with your fellow programmers.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.650
It may one day lead to you impressing a potential employer.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.390
See you in the next one, Bye-bye
