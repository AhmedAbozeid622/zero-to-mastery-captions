00:00.760 --> 00:02.080
Welcome back.

00:02.080 --> 00:10.090
I wanted to show you quickly another option you have for an editor and I mean there are a ton of options

00:10.090 --> 00:16.630
for you to choose from of where you want to write your code and I prefer Sublime Text But I want to

00:16.630 --> 00:23.950
show you Visual Studio code as well because between Sublime Text and Visual Studio code these two are

00:23.950 --> 00:30.110
probably the most used most popular code editors for web developers.

00:30.220 --> 00:36.160
Now the way you get Visual Studio code is while you go to their Web site and just download whichever

00:36.490 --> 00:39.550
operating system you're on my case it's a Mac.

00:39.550 --> 00:48.530
So I'll just download that and once it's downloaded I can just unzip it open it up from here we can

00:48.530 --> 00:53.770
just open Visual Studio code and there we have it nice and easy.

00:53.780 --> 01:00.710
Now the reason a lot of people like Visual Studio code is that it's free unlike sublime tax that allows

01:00.710 --> 01:03.370
you to well still use it for free.

01:03.380 --> 01:08.550
But every once in a while you get an annoying pop up to purchase the full subscription.

01:09.580 --> 01:17.200
Visual Studio code actually has a really really nice plug ins and tools to make developing better.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.890
Personally I like subline tax just because it is nice and simple and clean.

01:22.750 --> 01:26.950
I find visual studio code can get noisy although you can change things around.

01:27.070 --> 01:30.060
But let me show you how I would set up Visual Studio code.

01:32.650 --> 01:39.320
Well we can just create a new file and let's create a new javascript file file save this save it to

01:39.320 --> 01:40.810
desktop and we'll call the script.

01:40.820 --> 01:41.570
RJ Yes.

01:43.660 --> 01:49.010
One of the really neat things about the code and let's make this a little bit bigger.

01:49.200 --> 02:03.000
If I create an object here let's say object and this will have a name of Sally.

02:03.110 --> 02:08.270
If I go object dot Whoops that's not what I wanted.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.880
Object dot.

02:11.030 --> 02:15.870
You see that I get auto suggestions from vs code.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.150
I don't have to install any plug ins.

02:18.380 --> 02:19.000
Nothing at all.

02:19.010 --> 02:25.390
But it detects what this object has as a property and it auto completes for us.

02:25.580 --> 02:31.370
And underneath the hood it's using something called Intellisense and they give you a ton of suggestions

02:31.370 --> 02:32.030
when you're typing.

02:32.030 --> 02:38.510
As you can see here for example if I type in the window object I see all the methods and properties

02:38.510 --> 02:45.490
that I can access which is really really nice and people really like this and if I make any mistakes

02:45.550 --> 02:51.670
in my code you see that I get that underlined in red saying hey there's something wrong here.

02:51.700 --> 02:55.300
So that's really really nice and has a few more options.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.240
It has a debug feature that is really nice.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.220
It also integrates with hub and source control.

03:02.240 --> 03:07.930
My favorite feature is we can actually open up the terminal in here.

03:08.090 --> 03:13.130
You see that I have my terminal right and my code editor which is really really nice you don't have

03:13.130 --> 03:20.030
to switch between the screens like I do when I use subline tax and eiter although I actually like that

03:20.180 --> 03:23.980
some people prefer having everything and just one go.

03:24.090 --> 03:31.070
Now if I was using VS code there's two plug ins that I really recommend and if I go do fall over here

03:31.640 --> 03:39.080
or let's go to code preferences and then do extensions there is a ton of extension here just like sublime

03:39.080 --> 03:39.730
text.

03:39.830 --> 03:47.400
And one of my favorites that I like using with the Skoda is coca and I'll show you what it does in a

03:47.400 --> 03:47.890
second.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.490
I'm going to install this and I've actually already installed it.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.730
So I don't have to click anything here.

03:53.730 --> 03:58.140
In your case you might have to click install will install it for you.

03:58.140 --> 04:01.700
And once it's installed I can do something fun.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.950
I can do command shift key.

04:05.310 --> 04:11.720
Or if you're using Windows might a control shift B and it's going to display the editor's command palette

04:12.510 --> 04:14.780
which again works the same as sublime text.

04:14.940 --> 04:21.710
And if I do I think Quoc I hear you see the list of commands that I can use and most like in your case

04:21.740 --> 04:24.190
you want to start a new javascript file.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.640
So if I do this.

04:25.660 --> 04:27.290
Check out what happens now.

04:27.860 --> 04:36.810
If I create an object let's say object and I start typing a say name.

04:36.930 --> 04:41.280
You see that it's actually evaluating the script and giving me an error.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.420
So name is not defined.

04:42.420 --> 04:55.370
If I do name is Sally all right everything is good and if I start typing things like Sally Daut Hi I'll

04:55.370 --> 05:01.220
say Sally is not defined and it actually evaluates while we're writing which is really really neat and

05:01.280 --> 05:06.870
I can just have Koca evaluate what I'm currently writing a book about.

05:06.890 --> 05:11.780
I see that object has name sout very very cool.

05:11.780 --> 05:13.790
So that's a really really fun plug in.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.410
Another one that I really like.

05:15.470 --> 05:17.140
And no we don't need to save that.

05:17.180 --> 05:24.230
Another one that I really would like and probably the only other one that I would add is the dean dent

05:24.770 --> 05:29.070
Decatur.

05:29.290 --> 05:37.540
And again I have that already installed the nice things with the indicator is if you notice here I have

05:37.540 --> 05:38.850
these lines.

05:38.860 --> 05:39.720
Let's have another

05:42.450 --> 05:48.450
object within an object you see that these lines are being highlighted here showing me where I am and

05:48.450 --> 05:51.170
the code block which I find very useful.

05:52.240 --> 05:58.560
And then finally just like with Sublime Text You can change the theme that you have.

05:58.570 --> 06:06.910
So if you go to color theme for example you have a few default ones and a few others say you can just

06:07.090 --> 06:08.590
install.

06:08.590 --> 06:14.190
So I actually installed night owl which is one of my favorites.

06:14.270 --> 06:19.280
I can see that you can download different themes and customize it to your liking.

06:19.300 --> 06:20.700
That's enough about vs code.

06:20.710 --> 06:23.440
Everybody has their own favorite coded editor.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.500
There's no right one for web development.

06:26.530 --> 06:33.220
You just pick the tool that you find yourself liking the most and you find your work the best with some

06:33.220 --> 06:33.520
people.

06:33.520 --> 06:38.730
Like a lot of plug ins some people like the simplicity of Sublime Text.

06:38.890 --> 06:44.230
It's all up to you just customize it however you want because at the end of the day it doesn't matter

06:44.230 --> 06:46.810
what code it Ed. you use.

06:46.880 --> 06:53.900
But if I had to recommend to definitely sublime taxed or the code I'll see in the next one.

06:53.980 --> 06:54.240
Bob.
