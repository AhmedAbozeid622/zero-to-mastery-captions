00:01.020 --> 00:06.600
Let's talk about how we can set up NPM on our computers so we can start using it. If we wanted to

00:06.600 --> 00:08.740
learn react, well,

00:08.790 --> 00:13.990
React is actually a package created by Facebook that we're going to be using in the next section.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.830
We need to get it and then how do we do that.

00:16.890 --> 00:25.320
First thing we need is this. We need to download Node.js which comes with NPM you can see over here that

00:25.320 --> 00:31.830
the Latest LTS, which means Long Term Support version 8.9.1 includes NPM and

00:31.830 --> 00:33.670
you have the version numbers here as well.

00:33.690 --> 00:37.130
So for Windows you can install here, Mac here,

00:37.170 --> 00:40.100
Anything else you can use the source code as well.

00:40.170 --> 00:46.710
You simply click on your operating system of choice and you'll have your node package install

00:46.800 --> 00:52.510
You simply click and it will install everything for you and take you through the whole process.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.550
This should be very quick.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.140
You can do it in less than a minute.

00:55.350 --> 00:57.400
Now why do we need Node

00:57.420 --> 01:01.360
And what is Node is probably what's going through your head right now.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.470
And don't worry we'll get through it.

01:03.480 --> 01:10.560
The simple version of it is that Node allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

01:10.560 --> 01:17.400
I mean up until this point every time we wanted to use JavaScript we either wrote it here in the console

01:17.910 --> 01:24.090
or we attached a script file to HTML and loaded the HTML file in the browser.

01:24.360 --> 01:32.460
As you know each browser has a JavaScript engine such as the V8 engine that Chrome has. But that was

01:32.460 --> 01:36.350
the only thing that was able to read JavaScript. Outside of a browser,

01:36.360 --> 01:43.800
we need something to read it to understand it and Node.js was created actually using the V8 engine

01:44.190 --> 01:51.720
that the Google Chrome browser uses to read JavaScript and run JavaScript outside of the browser.

01:52.730 --> 01:55.290
But like I said, we'll get into that later.

01:55.310 --> 01:58.690
For now let's download

01:58.740 --> 01:59.370
Node.js

01:59.630 --> 02:02.890
which automatically installs NPM for you.

02:03.110 --> 02:10.070
And don't worry in the next section I have resources for you to go through this step line by line both

02:10.070 --> 02:14.710
for Windows and Mac and also some troubleshooting in case you run into errors.

02:14.750 --> 02:19.280
Now after you've installed everything there is a simple way to check that everything is working.

02:20.340 --> 02:31.170
You just go to your terminal and you type in 'npm -v' and this should give you a version number.

02:31.290 --> 02:36.510
If that didn't work, well then go through the steps that I've listed for you and you should be able to

02:36.510 --> 02:37.570
get it.

02:37.590 --> 02:42.240
So you want to make sure that if you're watching this video and going on through the rest of the course

02:42.240 --> 02:47.290
when we're building our projects, you want to make sure that NPM our version is higher than

02:47.320 --> 02:49.350
5.5.1

02:49.560 --> 02:51.720
Otherwise it might not work.

02:51.870 --> 02:58.650
And we also want to make sure that we have Node and we simply do 'node -v'

02:58.830 --> 03:04.540
And again we want to make sure that our Node version is higher than 8.9.1

03:04.540 --> 03:07.950
Now let's say that for some reason these are lower.

03:07.970 --> 03:13.030
Well, Node -you simply go to the Web site and they'll have the latest version for you which should be

03:13.120 --> 03:14.920
fine with this.

03:14.950 --> 03:24.780
With NPM, if for some reason this is lower, you can simply run 'npm install npm@latest -g'

03:25.000 --> 03:28.630
I don't think you'll run into there so you should be good.

03:28.660 --> 03:34.690
Finally, while running through NPM commands which is why we'll use to download things and I'll show you

03:34.690 --> 03:36.410
how to do that in the next video.

03:36.490 --> 03:43.200
You might run into some permission errors where you're running a command like 'npm install react' for example.

03:43.210 --> 03:49.540
When you press enter you might get some permission errors. In that case,

03:49.540 --> 03:56.770
that means that your user whatever you're logged into to your computer doesn't have permission rights.

03:56.770 --> 04:02.520
Maybe they're not the administrator at all the computer in which case you'll have to run these commands

04:02.530 --> 04:12.910
as the administrator which simply means running 'sudo npm install react' and it'll ask for your username

04:12.910 --> 04:13.770
and password.

04:13.930 --> 04:15.220
you're going to have links to this after this video.

04:15.220 --> 04:20.950
If you're on Windows there is a different command and sudo again both found and the

04:20.970 --> 04:23.990
resources after this video.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.230
All right.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.840
So we have NPM and Node installed.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.410
Everything looks good.

04:29.460 --> 04:34.590
How can we start using NPM and even getting that package.json file that I keep talking about.

04:34.620 --> 04:44.390
It's very easy all you do is 'npm init' and any time you start a project you want to do the 'npm init'

04:44.420 --> 04:49.490
And this command creates a package.json file in your directory.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.530
So we have the background generator here.

04:51.620 --> 04:57.280
You'll see that after I run this command, it'll ask me a few questions and then package.json file

04:57.320 --> 04:59.070
will appear here.

04:59.090 --> 05:02.970
Let's go through it. And you can see over here it's going to walk me through the set up.

05:03.110 --> 05:05.530
I can name my package if I want.

05:05.570 --> 05:11.050
In this case I'm just going to keep pressing Enter because unless you are publishing an NPM package.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.380
You don't really need to worry about it, so I'm just going to keep pressing enter.

05:14.390 --> 05:19.640
But you can see I can add a few things about the author of the license of the project.

05:21.200 --> 05:28.610
I just keep pressing enter. And I don't know if you noticed but if I clear here and on the left,

05:28.610 --> 05:33.520
look at that, we have package.json file.

05:33.570 --> 05:35.140
Let's open it up.

05:35.250 --> 05:42.190
I'm going to minimize this a little bit so we can see it clearly and we have package.json.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.400
There you go.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.650
We have our name "background-generator"

05:45.830 --> 05:50.790
It's version 1.0.1, main is "script.js"

05:51.190 --> 05:56.320
It actually finds out where our main JavaScript file is and we have a couple of other things that we'll

05:56.320 --> 05:58.280
go through in the rest of the section.

05:58.390 --> 06:02.880
But one question you might be having is 'What is .json?'

06:02.880 --> 06:05.410
Up until this point, we've had

06:05.570 --> 06:07.600
.html .js  .css

06:07.630 --> 06:11.190
Well, json is a file format.

06:11.230 --> 06:19.150
You can see over here on the right hand side of the bottom that Sublime Text says this is a JSON(NPM) file.

06:20.700 --> 06:28.770
it's just a format and it looks kind of like a JavaScript object except for the fact that it has double

06:28.770 --> 06:31.350
quotes for properties.

06:31.350 --> 06:37.580
All right with this comes a lot of power so I'm excited to show you what we can do with this.

06:37.610 --> 06:38.750
I'll see you in the next one.
