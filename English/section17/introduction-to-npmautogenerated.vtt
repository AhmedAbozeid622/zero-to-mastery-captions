00:02.210 --> 00:10.700
NPM was created for developers to be able to share JavaScript code that they have written. This way

00:10.790 --> 00:16.660
any developer around the world can grab somebody else's code that may solve his or her problem.

00:17.780 --> 00:23.780
This creates a great knowledge base of scripts that people can constantly update or improve and build

00:23.780 --> 00:26.330
on top of. As a matter of fact,

00:26.330 --> 00:32.140
it is very rare that an app or a Web site these days are built purely from scratch.

00:32.990 --> 00:39.140
By using the collective intelligence we can grab pieces of code that are really good and build on top

00:39.140 --> 00:40.950
of it to create our product.

00:41.710 --> 00:48.070
For example using JavaScript you can write virtual reality applications but you don't have to figure

00:48.070 --> 00:50.120
out everything yourself.

00:50.140 --> 00:56.980
Someone out there already worked on being able to use JavaScript VR So you use that person's code to

00:56.980 --> 00:58.200
start your project.

00:58.270 --> 01:01.190
Lets talk about how NPM works.

01:02.650 --> 01:05.490
NPM looks like this.

01:05.560 --> 01:13.180
A Web site with a search bar kind of looks like Google but here you can search for what we call Packages

01:15.210 --> 01:23.180
and these packages are located in the NPM Registry and this Registry keeps track of files that have

01:23.180 --> 01:25.130
been submitted.

01:25.180 --> 01:33.100
Anybody can submit these files that are called packages or modules and they contain two things;

01:33.100 --> 01:35.640
A JavaScript file and a package.json file.

01:35.680 --> 01:43.010
and the package.json file which you've never seen before is a metafile that describes

01:43.280 --> 01:45.020
this package.

01:45.230 --> 01:54.540
So you can see here that this NPM registry is just a registry of all these files of JavaScript that

01:54.570 --> 01:55.770
other people have written.

01:56.850 --> 02:03.090
And the idea is to have small JavaScript files that do one thing really really well so that other people

02:03.270 --> 02:03.950
can use it.

02:05.140 --> 02:16.820
You then compose or combine different pieces of code and different packages on your project to add functionality

02:17.660 --> 02:22.400
and not have to rewrite something that has already been written by another person.

02:23.110 --> 02:29.980
So as you can see here I have let's say a person that has just written a JavaScript file that is really

02:29.980 --> 02:30.970
really useful.

02:30.970 --> 02:39.100
Well they think that other people might be able to use it so they push it up to the NPM Registry and

02:39.100 --> 02:46.670
by using the search bar over here somebody can find your package maybe they're looking to have a script file

02:46.720 --> 02:52.460
that creates a list of arrays for people interested in cats.

02:52.570 --> 03:02.100
Well then they are able to find this file and download it from NPM Registry onto their computer.

03:02.170 --> 03:05.140
So let's talk about the benefits from this.

03:06.470 --> 03:11.360
Well you get expertise from others, maybe you don't know everything,

03:11.370 --> 03:13.560
maybe others are better than you at

03:13.630 --> 03:18.280
this certain thing well you use that collective knowledge to use their code.

03:19.180 --> 03:21.580
But there's also a downside to this.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.770
Not all packages are good code.

03:24.840 --> 03:34.080
Anybody can put up their file to NPM, and you're also adding more bytes to your project which makes your

03:34.080 --> 03:36.210
project size even bigger.

03:36.210 --> 03:43.940
If you got all these files down into your project, well, that's a lot of files and each one is going to

03:43.940 --> 03:47.820
have to be sent from the server to the browser.

03:48.050 --> 03:54.110
And as you know from previous sections we want to minimize the size of our project so we built fast

03:54.250 --> 04:01.540
web apps and there is an art to finding good NPM packages and you will get used to it after a bit of

04:01.540 --> 04:02.300
experience.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.000
So don't worry.
 
04:04.270 --> 04:08.380
Now you also see here that I have something called the yarn.

04:08.690 --> 04:15.320
yarn still uses the NPM Registry but you might see it every once in a while just like NPM.

04:15.370 --> 04:19.010
It's a tool to grab things from the NPM Registry.

04:19.030 --> 04:26.560
We won't talk about it in this course but just keep in mind that both yarn and NPM are very very similar.

04:26.560 --> 04:32.800
If you learn one then you know the other so don't be afraid if you hear of a project that uses yarn

04:32.800 --> 04:38.470
instead of NPM. Now you can browse NPM and find things.

04:38.790 --> 04:42.840
But there's usually three types of packages.

04:43.060 --> 04:46.640
One is packages that you can use on the browser.

04:46.640 --> 04:52.390
So on the Front End, so that is you can download JQuery from NPM.

04:52.850 --> 04:58.010
You can download all sorts of scripts that help you with front end workflow.

04:58.030 --> 05:04.330
The second type are ones that give you new commands that you can use on the command line and I'll show you

05:04.330 --> 05:06.760
an example that later on in this section.

05:06.790 --> 05:15.100
And finally the third type of NPM package is once that you can use on Node.js on the Back End. 

05:15.100 --> 05:21.640
And that might sound scary to you but don't worry when we get to the Node.js section, I'll show you some of the Node packages

05:21.640 --> 05:25.240
that you can use, but it's pretty much the same thing as JavaScript.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.610
As a matter of fact NPM stands for Node Package Manager.

05:29.620 --> 05:35.200
It was initially built for node but it was so good and so popular that you can now use it for the Front End

05:35.200 --> 05:36.220
as well.

05:36.930 --> 05:38.820
But it's all the same thing.

05:38.820 --> 05:40.430
It all works the same.

05:40.530 --> 05:43.330
Like I said before they're just scripts that are

05:43.350 --> 05:49.710
you're able to use that other people have written and we're going to be using them a lot in this course.

05:49.710 --> 05:53.730
Now you might be asking yourself, why are we learning this.

05:53.790 --> 05:57.600
and this course? I mean, is it really that important?

05:57.960 --> 06:00.710
Yeah, actually there are three must do things.

06:00.810 --> 06:06.570
Now when starting a project in 2018 and you'll see it in every single project.

06:06.570 --> 06:09.690
One is that -well, they have an HTML file,

06:09.820 --> 06:12.610
CSS file or JavaScript file.

06:12.960 --> 06:18.660
They may have -they might have multiple of these but all projects have those especially ones that are

06:18.660 --> 06:19.820
web based.

06:19.830 --> 06:27.060
You also have to have your project on github and use source control like Git. Nobody stores their own

06:27.060 --> 06:28.260
project on their computer.

06:28.260 --> 06:31.820
They always have it with source control.

06:31.950 --> 06:39.090
And finally you manage dependencies which is packages that other people have written. With NPM using

06:39.300 --> 06:41.480
package.json file.

06:41.490 --> 06:48.300
So in this section we're going to be working on this and finishing up our set up of how a typical project

06:48.300 --> 06:52.520
looks like in 2018 and we know how to do the first two, right?

06:52.770 --> 06:58.650
Now in the next two videos I'm going to show you how to start using NPM to download files and using

06:58.650 --> 07:01.900
package.json to manage those files.

07:02.250 --> 07:07.060
It is a critical part of a developer workflow. So I'll see you in the next one. byebye.
