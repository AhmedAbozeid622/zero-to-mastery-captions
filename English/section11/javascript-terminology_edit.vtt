Hey there, welcome back! In this quick video I just want to go over the terminology that we've been using

00:06.090 --> 00:06.750
again.

00:06.750 --> 00:11.780
I'm just going to repeat it, so that you really have it nailed.

00:12.030 --> 00:20.490
The first one that we've learned about is the idea of 'function declaration' and 'function declaration' is a

00:20.490 --> 00:23.310
way for us to create functions

00:29.700 --> 00:31.840
like this.

00:31.900 --> 00:39.910
We also learned about 'function expression' and 'function expression' is a way for us to create functions

00:40.420 --> 00:41.680
with a variable like

00:44.300 --> 00:44.690
this.

00:50.770 --> 00:55.160
And 'function expressions' can also have names.

00:59.330 --> 01:05.220
Or it could be an anonymous function like this.

01:05.220 --> 01:10.040
You're more likely to encounter this than with names.

01:10.220 --> 01:12.690
But I want to show you both of those.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.370
OK.

01:13.550 --> 01:14.530
What else do we have?

01:14.660 --> 01:19.950
We also have this idea of 'expression' and an 'expression' is...

01:20.060 --> 01:27.580
Well, this actually gives it a good-good overview and 'expression' is something that denotes a value.

01:27.590 --> 01:34.030
So, '1+3;' is an 'expression' and we end 'expressions' with semicolon.

01:34.340 --> 01:38.280
If we do 'var a = 2;' that's an 'expression'.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.960
If we're returning something from a function, we're returning 'true',

01:42.080 --> 01:46.430
that's an expression. So an 'expression' is something that produces a value.

01:46.690 --> 01:51.390
OK. How do we make a function perform that action?

01:51.440 --> 01:58.370
Well, we call that 'calling' or 'invoking' a function.

01:59.090 --> 02:03.270
And we do that by doing 'alert'.

02:03.460 --> 02:15.460
And then the brackets or we can do something like 'newFunction', 'param1', 'param2' and we call

02:15.850 --> 02:31.900
or invoke a function this way. We also assign a variable and we do that by, well, we assign 'var a = true;' 

02:32.210 --> 02:37.540
OK. We also learn about 'function vs. methods'.

02:38.740 --> 02:43.960
Or method and a function is something like

02:44.090 --> 02:46.670
'thisIsAFunction'

02:50.030 --> 03:04.860
A 'method' is something that is inside of an object, like 'thisIsAMethod'.

03:04.890 --> 03:08.580
So the way we access them is different.

03:08.580 --> 03:21.520
A 'function' is accessed like this, a 'method' is accessed with a 'dot' in front of it.

03:24.700 --> 03:29.290
And there you have it: a few terminologies that I've been using that

03:29.290 --> 03:35.720
hopefully, you've learned them by now, but wanted to recap everything, so that it really really sticks.

03:35.770 --> 03:39.230
And this should make everything more clear.

03:40.550 --> 03:41.860
I'll see you in the next one.

03:42.070 --> 03:42.320
Bye-Bye
