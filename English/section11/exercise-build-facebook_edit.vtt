Hello! Welcome back. In this video we're going to combine everything that we just learned to show you

00:08.310 --> 00:10.540
why JavaScript is useful.

00:10.620 --> 00:18.380
Because I know some of you are thinking: OK, we learned a whole bunch of new ways of writing JavaScript

00:18.390 --> 00:25.120
and we learned about arrays and objects, but I don't really know how that relates to me building

00:25.120 --> 00:27.560
websites or web apps?

00:28.110 --> 00:34.280
Well, I'm going to show you that we can build a simplified version of Facebook with what we just learned.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.510
So let's get started.

00:36.830 --> 00:43.010
We're going to have a database with usernames and passwords. We're going to have a 'newsfeed' and we're

00:43.010 --> 00:44.780
going to have users.

00:44.840 --> 00:51.020
So let's start off by thinking about how Facebook works. With Facebook

00:51.020 --> 00:55.420
we have a sign-up form usually. We need to sign in.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.330
And once we sign in, if it's correct, it goes to our profile, where we can view our 'newsfeed'.

01:03.380 --> 01:10.180
So let's build that. We can start off with having something called a 'database'.

01:10.180 --> 01:12.520
So we'll have a variable 'database'.

01:12.520 --> 01:16.810
And in this 'database' we can have multiple users.

01:16.810 --> 01:17.230
Right?

01:17.350 --> 01:23.210
So, what do we need here? We need an array - a list of users.

01:23.230 --> 01:24.790
So now I can say

01:28.110 --> 01:36.000
I have a 'username' and this might look familiar from our previous lessons. We have a 'username' of 'andrei'

01:37.140 --> 01:42.740
and a 'password' of 'supersecret'.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.700
For now we're just going to leave it at one user.

01:46.700 --> 01:50.670
We have a 'database' and we also want to have a 'newsfeed', right?

01:50.720 --> 01:56.730
So let's have a variable called 'newsfeed' and in here, a newsfeed,

01:56.740 --> 02:15.350
well, again it's a list, an array of news. So we can have a 'username' - 'Bobby', that on his timeline has maybe,

02:15.590 --> 02:26.200
'So tired from all that learning!'. We also have, we have more than one item usually in a 'newsfeed'.

02:26.200 --> 02:39.330
We can say that 'username', 'Sally'. 'Sally' on her time line just posted 'Javascript is sooooooo cooooool!'.

02:41.660 --> 02:42.240
OK.

02:42.560 --> 02:53.070
So we have a 'newsfeed', which has an array of objects and we have a 'database', which is an array of just a

02:53.070 --> 02:55.980
single object right now: a 'username' and 'password'.

02:56.950 --> 03:01.190
Now how can we build a 'sign-in' form?

03:01.360 --> 03:10.500
Well, we would want to perform an action to check a user's credentials: their 'username' and 'password'.

03:10.550 --> 03:12.000
Well, we've done this before, right?

03:12.020 --> 03:24.170
We've used 'prompt' before, accepts a user's input. So we can do variable 'userNamePrompt'

03:24.500 --> 03:29.320
We'll say equals 'prompt':

03:29.680 --> 03:32.310
"What's your username?"

03:34.500 --> 03:35.370
OK.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.930
We also have

03:36.930 --> 03:39.300
And I'm going to make this smaller just so everything fits in here.

03:39.300 --> 03:53.050
Hopefully you can still see. We have variable 'passwordPrompt', that equals 'prompt("What's your password?")

03:54.080 --> 03:57.680
'?' OK.

03:57.860 --> 04:00.970
So, we have this working.

04:01.250 --> 04:10.590
When we open up this file and refresh: HTML is going to get loaded line by line. And we see, oh, we have

04:10.590 --> 04:11.280
a script.

04:11.340 --> 04:17.590
Let me load the script and then the browser reads line by line.

04:17.670 --> 04:19.030
We have a 'database'.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.500
We have a 'newsfeed'.

04:20.970 --> 04:26.540
And then it's going to say 'usernamePrompt' equals 'prompt'. And it's going to ask us for "What's your user

04:26.540 --> 04:26.930
name?"

04:27.150 --> 04:30.310
And then it's going to ask us for "What's your password?"

04:30.460 --> 04:32.400
Well, let's just test that.

04:32.490 --> 04:35.410
I'm going to save and refresh and there you go.

04:35.460 --> 04:42.730
"What's your user name?" - "andrei" and "What's your password?" - "supersecret".

04:43.260 --> 04:53.040
That's very nice, but when I sign in, I either want to know that my password is incorrect or if I log

04:53.040 --> 04:54.550
in and everything is correct.

04:54.780 --> 04:56.830
I want to get my 'newsfeed, right?

04:57.970 --> 05:05.560
So it sounds like we need to perform an action, but we don't really have a sign in function in JavaScript,

05:05.560 --> 05:05.920
do we?

05:05.920 --> 05:10.310
It's a custom function, that we need to build ourself.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.080
So let's think about this.

05:13.090 --> 05:20.880
We want to create a function called 'signIn' and to sign in, what do we need?

05:20.980 --> 05:25.800
Well, we need a 'username' and 'password'.

05:27.410 --> 05:32.450
And we can name these whatever we want and just to prove that to you I'm just going to do 'user'

05:35.190 --> 05:36.300
and 'password'.

05:36.730 --> 05:39.500
We'll, do 'pass' like that. OK.

05:39.530 --> 05:43.610
And if we remember, to create a function, this is 'function declaration'

05:43.610 --> 05:48.310
I have my curly brackets and in here I can do something.

05:48.350 --> 05:53.780
So, again let's think about this logically: in order to sign in,

05:53.800 --> 05:57.300
I need to check 'username' and 'password'.

05:57.640 --> 06:08.990
Well, if the function gets the first argument 'user', well I can say that 'if (username)' - in this case 'user'

06:10.780 --> 06:12.940
equals, well, what does it equal?

06:12.950 --> 06:16.820
You need to check against our 'database' right?

06:17.310 --> 06:25.770
Our 'database', when 'andrei' signed up for Facebook, he put his 'username' down, and 'password' down, so we have

06:25.770 --> 06:32.220
that information. So, we can say, that when you sign in we're going to check 'user' to see that the 'user'

06:32.430 --> 06:35.080
matches 'database'.

06:35.580 --> 06:36.790
And it's an array.

06:37.050 --> 06:45.660
So we're going to grab the first element in the array and we're going to grab the 'username'

06:50.170 --> 06:50.760
OK.

06:51.110 --> 06:55.310
And we also want to check the 'password', right?

06:55.310 --> 06:57.970
So, what do we do when we have to check two things?

06:57.980 --> 07:10.120
Well it's a conditional, that has "&&". So here I can say: the 'password' should equal 'database' - first item in

07:10.120 --> 07:11.060
the array.

07:11.290 --> 07:15.640
And this time instead of 'username' it's 'password'.

07:15.890 --> 07:18.200
I'm going to put this on a new line just so you can see it.

07:18.200 --> 07:18.820
There you go!

07:20.770 --> 07:30.610
So, 'signIn' function is going to say if 'user' equals whatever we have in the 'database': 'username', and 'password'

07:30.610 --> 07:36.190
equals whatever we have in the 'database'. If that is right,

07:36.220 --> 07:48.580
well, we can say 'console.log', and we'll say - 'newsfeed'. Else, if the 'password' or 'username' is not correct, we'll

07:48.640 --> 07:51.140
just say 'alert'.

07:51.550 --> 07:58.890
"Sorry, wrong username and password!"

07:58.980 --> 08:06.800
So, we have our function, but this disappeared somewhere. And we'll save this.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.720
And let's just refresh. OK.

08:09.930 --> 08:11.470
"What is your user name?"

08:11.520 --> 08:13.680
We'll say 'andrei"

08:13.790 --> 08:15.290
And "What is your password?"

08:15.410 --> 08:19.750
Well, we'll say - "supersecret". I pressed enter.

08:20.030 --> 08:20.350
OK.

08:20.360 --> 08:25.660
And now nothing happens, because well we haven't callback function, right?

08:25.670 --> 08:27.670
We just know that 'signIn' exists.

08:27.820 --> 08:38.510
Let's just check that 'signIn' exists. 'signIn is not defined'. It's because I spelled it, I spelled it wrong

08:39.230 --> 08:40.150
Let's do 'signIn' again.

08:40.190 --> 08:43.370
Let's refresh. 'andrei'

08:43.660 --> 08:46.800
'supersecret'

08:46.950 --> 08:51.370
And if I look for a 'signIn' now - there's the function.

08:51.390 --> 09:05.660
So, let's run it. Let's do 'signIn'. And we'll say: 'usernamePrompt', 'passwordPrompt'.

09:05.810 --> 09:08.450
Look at that. We just received our 'newsfeed'.

09:08.690 --> 09:09.320
That's very cool.

09:09.320 --> 09:16.090
Let's put this inside though, so the script just runs and then we'll get our answer right away.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.340
So, we'll do:

09:17.520 --> 09:22.230
'usernamePrompt' and 'passwordPrompt'.

09:23.110 --> 09:29.780
Now, just to show you what I did here, I am calling the function 'signIn' that accepts two parameters:

09:29.890 --> 09:32.410
'user' and 'password'.

09:32.440 --> 09:38.950
So, when I call the function, I'm going to give it two arguments to match those parameters.

09:38.950 --> 09:43.750
I'm going to give it the 'usernamePrompt', which contains whatever we've written in the first 'prompt'

09:44.290 --> 09:49.060
and then 'passwordPrompt', which contains whatever we read and the second 'prompt'.

09:49.060 --> 09:58.630
So now, if I save this and refresh, I can say "What's your username?" - 'andre', 'password' - 'supersecret'.

10:01.270 --> 10:04.930
And look at that. Now I'm logged in and I can view that "Bobby" is

10:04.940 --> 10:10.830
"So tired from all that learning" and "Sally", well, Sally finds "javascript really-really cool".

10:12.240 --> 10:16.480
Let's also try out the 'else' statement in case we mess up our information.

10:16.530 --> 10:23.580
I press refresh and I do "andrei", and for password I'll just do "1, 2, 3". I'll get:

10:23.580 --> 10:25.990
"Sorry, wrong username and password!"

10:27.640 --> 10:28.740
There you go.

10:28.780 --> 10:35.620
We've built a basic Facebook and that's what's so amazing about JavaScript is that you look at websites

10:35.620 --> 10:41.440
like Facebook, that seem really-really complicated, but they're all made of these small chunks. And the

10:41.440 --> 10:48.990
functionality, that you see on Facebook, is exactly that, when we are 'signIn' and they're checking the signing

10:49.000 --> 10:55.060
information against a 'database' and then, based on if we're right or wrong, we either get the 'newsfeed'

10:55.060 --> 10:57.180
or we get, you know, "Please sign in again".

10:58.030 --> 11:03.430
And that's the power of JavaScript right here. And this is why I'm so excited to teach you the topic

11:03.460 --> 11:09.670
because it opens up a whole new possibility of pretty much doing anything online now.

11:11.150 --> 11:12.970
I have another exciting video for you

11:12.970 --> 11:14.110
coming up next.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.260
I'll see you in that one. Bye-bye
