00:00.740 --> 00:09.690
Welcome back. JavaScript was created in 1995 buy the Netscape web browser right over here. It was a way

00:10.080 --> 00:17.490
for them to be able to add actions to websites. Think of JavaScript as the verb in anything you do on

00:17.490 --> 00:24.670
a website. You tweet, you play a YouTube video, you sign up for a user name.

00:24.690 --> 00:30.150
These are all actions we take on websites made possible through JavaScript.

00:30.150 --> 00:36.870
In 1995 it was a way for this browser, Netscape, to beat the competition which were other browsers at

00:36.870 --> 00:40.710
the time, because at the time Netscape was the most popular.

00:40.980 --> 00:45.690
Other browsers started adopting their own version of JavaScript, so that websites were work on their

00:45.690 --> 00:51.490
browsers as well and thus less people switch over to their browsers.

00:51.490 --> 00:53.360
Can you guess what happened next?

00:53.620 --> 00:58.290
Well, every browser had their own idea of what JavaScript was.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.090
So there was no standard.

01:00.310 --> 01:08.370
Eventually a standard had to be created to make sure that everyone had the same idea what JavaScript was.

01:08.410 --> 01:14.320
So that web developers can build one website and have it work on all browsers.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.290
This standard was called ECMAScript.

01:16.300 --> 01:23.650
So yes, JavaScript and ECMAScript can be used interchangeably and you will hear both of these a lot.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.790
But it's the same language. Now

01:27.010 --> 01:33.830
this browser compatibility issue - browsers having their own teams, their own schedule and their own code.

01:33.850 --> 01:35.810
Sound familiar?

01:35.850 --> 01:41.950
Yep! If you remember, it's the same thing that happened with HTML and CSS.

01:42.030 --> 01:44.190
It's the same issue that we keep having

01:44.200 --> 01:45.610
over and over.

01:45.940 --> 01:49.620
We covered this topic in 'Web Developer Fundamentals Part 2'.

01:49.770 --> 01:53.790
You see, it's always a big problem:

01:53.850 --> 01:58.660
Make sure that all browsers have the same understanding of what (a) real

01:58.680 --> 02:06.720
HTML, CSSA and JavaScript should be. So that when we send each one of those files, we don't have to

02:06.720 --> 02:14.600
write one specific for each browser and just like HTML and CSS, JavaScript is evolving.

02:14.750 --> 02:21.770
So there are new things that we can do now, that you weren't able to do in 1995 with JavaScript. In the

02:21.880 --> 02:28.900
'ES6' video section later on in the course we will talk about these new features, so don't worry.

02:29.050 --> 02:32.430
Now let's take a look at what JavaScript does.

02:32.470 --> 02:37.270
We can open up the browser and I have 'Udemy' over here.

02:37.730 --> 02:40.300
Well 'Udemy' uses a lot of JavaScript.

02:40.310 --> 02:46.930
I mean, clicking on a course, adding it to cart, liking the post.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.570
All these things.

02:48.680 --> 02:55.940
Well, they're all JavaScript. Even if you open categories over here, you see this dropdown and I can select

02:55.940 --> 03:00.400
things and there's actions, constantly happening throughout the website.

03:00.710 --> 03:07.990
That's all JavaScript. But it's not just the Web, that use JavaScript on. Instagram?

03:08.060 --> 03:11.840
Well Instagram uses JavaScript.

03:11.870 --> 03:13.250
What about something else?

03:13.250 --> 03:16.280
Maybe, virtual reality?

03:16.300 --> 03:16.630
Yeah.

03:16.780 --> 03:17.620
You can do that too.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.590
You can do 'VR', 'VR games',

03:20.590 --> 03:26.030
'VR apps' with JavaScript. That's, that's pretty cool.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.520
What else can JavaScript do?

03:27.620 --> 03:35.730
Well, you can actually program drones with JavaScript and control them from your Wii remote if you wanted

03:35.730 --> 03:36.160
to.

03:37.410 --> 03:39.260
What about robotics?

03:39.270 --> 03:42.170
Yeah, this guy built a robot.

03:43.830 --> 03:47.120
That he can control from his web browser.

03:48.950 --> 03:49.980
How cool is that.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.600
Now remember Node.js?

03:54.530 --> 03:59.850
We talked about this slide at the beginning of the course and how we're going to learn these topics.

03:59.850 --> 04:03.600
Well, some of this is able to be done because of it.

04:03.950 --> 04:07.820
But Node.js is pretty much JavaScript, it is JavaScript.

04:07.820 --> 04:09.710
So you learn JavaScript.

04:09.710 --> 04:15.380
You can pick up backend stuff very easily and the 'Node.js' section of this course will be a breeze.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.720
It's not a new language

04:16.760 --> 04:17.760
that you'll learn.

04:18.140 --> 04:19.600
So is Express.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.480
So is React.

04:21.530 --> 04:24.200
So this is why JavaScript is so important.

04:24.260 --> 04:28.410
What we will learn here will take you very far in the rest of your career.

04:28.430 --> 04:32.270
This is one skill that really opens up a lot of possibilities.

04:33.610 --> 04:39.250
Here's the beauty of JavaScript though and any other programming languages, because what is JavaScript

04:39.250 --> 04:46.800
really? It's, it's a file, a father who can write instructions to a computer.

04:47.010 --> 04:50.580
In the example of a robot arm all you had to do is write.

04:50.620 --> 04:54.610
If I press this button - move arm to the right, if I press this button -

04:54.760 --> 04:56.100
move arm to the left.

04:57.030 --> 05:03.150
It all looks extremely complicated, but as you will see, no matter how complex the program, let's say an

05:03.150 --> 05:05.830
online game like 'World of Warcraft',

05:05.960 --> 05:08.840
well, everything is built one block at a time.

05:08.850 --> 05:15.720
One simple logic at a time. In the next section we're going to start writing our first JavaScript in

05:15.720 --> 05:17.860
our first simple pieces of logic.

05:18.180 --> 05:20.820
Don't let it fool you though. Although it may look simple.

05:20.820 --> 05:27.730
These are the building blocks that allow you to build big web apps like Facebook or Google. Exciting

05:27.730 --> 05:29.910
things are going to happen with your newfound power.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.310
So I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
