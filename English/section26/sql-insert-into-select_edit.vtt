00:00.730 --> 00:01.480
Welcome back.

00:01.660 --> 00:04.700
Let's go back into our database.

00:04.840 --> 00:10.830
We've just created our users table. But now we want to actually insert some information. How can we do

00:10.830 --> 00:20.940
that? Again using SQL we have the 'insert into' command that we're able to insert into whichever

00:20.940 --> 00:22.340
table name we want.

00:22.470 --> 00:29.910
We're going to specify the column and then the values of each of those respective columns and always

00:29.910 --> 00:31.300
ending in a semicolon.

00:32.250 --> 00:37.910
I also want to emphasize that with SQL the capitalization is just a standard.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.470
But if I made this lowercase it will still work.

00:40.590 --> 00:42.480
It's case insensitive.

00:43.260 --> 00:47.680
So looking at our database we have name, age and birthday.

00:47.790 --> 00:53.430
Let's insert something. We'll say that we want to insert into

00:56.200 --> 00:56.690
users

00:59.350 --> 01:06.030
column_1 will be name and then we have age,

01:10.140 --> 01:10.550
birthday

01:13.910 --> 01:20.390
and no you don't have to insert every time into every column. You can just change the name if you want.

01:22.740 --> 01:24.480
Alright name will be

01:27.450 --> 01:27.930
'Andrei'

01:30.730 --> 01:43.860
value will be 31 and then BIRTHDAY we'll say is if you remember the day syntax if i open up here is

01:43.980 --> 01:46.650
this year, month, date.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.380
So I simply do 19-

01:50.090 --> 02:03.840
I'm going to make myself really old. We'll say January 25th. Press enter I get insert, awesome. If I do

02:03.840 --> 02:05.430
\d again.

02:06.500 --> 02:11.000
I see my table but how can I see the value that I just entered.

02:12.310 --> 02:13.630
Well first let's check here.

02:13.930 --> 02:23.470
Let's check with our GUI. Click on content, select users and look at that name, age, birthday. I have Andrei

02:23.590 --> 02:26.110
31 with my birthday.

02:27.460 --> 02:28.650
Very cool.

02:28.660 --> 02:31.300
Now, how can we grab this information?

02:33.950 --> 02:40.860
Again a SQL syntax is 'select' and we want to say what we want to select.

02:40.910 --> 02:44.780
In our case we can say name, age, birthday.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.300
From and then the table name.

02:48.470 --> 02:52.850
In our case users. Semi-colon, press enter and look at that

02:52.970 --> 03:02.960
I get Andrei, age 31, birthday. If I want to just grab the entire columns without spelling out everything.

03:02.960 --> 03:11.820
Imagine if we had tons of columns. We can use the wildcard symbol of star that's shift + 8 to get star

03:13.280 --> 03:14.480
and I get the same thing.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.620
Very cool.

03:16.840 --> 03:23.950
By the way with PSequel, we can actually run these queries here.

03:23.950 --> 03:25.430
See how it already has 'select'.

03:25.480 --> 03:33.670
I can say select * from users and it even gives me nice coloring, press ENTER or press semicolon

03:34.360 --> 03:37.490
and run query and look at that.

03:37.650 --> 03:43.800
It gives me the table for me. And it also has the history which is really really nice.

03:45.230 --> 03:47.050
Let's add a few more users here.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.860
I'm going to insert this time somebody else.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.740
I'm just going to change a few things.

03:57.040 --> 04:02.580
41 And Sally inserted.

04:02.670 --> 04:08.750
If I select star from users I have Andrei and Sally. Going back here,

04:08.790 --> 04:13.080
run query. I have Andre and Sally in the database.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.010
How cool is that.

04:14.810 --> 04:16.880
All right we know how to create a table.

04:16.940 --> 04:22.850
We know how to insert into a table and we know how to grab this information. We can already start picturing

04:22.910 --> 04:28.860
what powers we can have now with our final project. But there's still a few more things we want to learn.

04:29.780 --> 04:32.660
For that I'll see you in the next video bye-bye.
