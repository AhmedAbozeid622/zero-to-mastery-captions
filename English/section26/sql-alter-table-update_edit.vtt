00:00.990 --> 00:01.980
Welcome back.

00:02.190 --> 00:06.110
I've added one more user here so we have a little bit of a bigger database.

00:07.030 --> 00:08.720
But let's say we have a problem.

00:08.790 --> 00:15.180
We realized that we we're working on this project and oops we actually needed to also include a score

00:15.300 --> 00:15.910
column.

00:16.020 --> 00:21.710
How can we add another column to a pre-existing table.

00:21.730 --> 00:33.440
We have SQL for that, we can use alter table. And using this format we can add a new column.

00:33.490 --> 00:45.350
So let's say that in the users table we want to add a column that is score and data type, we want - let's

00:45.350 --> 00:50.290
say smallint, a score that can be over 30,000.

00:50.430 --> 00:53.970
So let's say Max score is a thousand so smallint will be fine.

00:54.180 --> 00:58.370
I press enter and now we have altered table.

00:58.510 --> 00:59.530
If I refresh here.

01:02.560 --> 01:08.850
Go to users, I see that I have scores but we have a problem now.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.930
We have scores but it's null.

01:11.990 --> 01:14.200
There's nothing for these users.

01:14.200 --> 01:22.320
What if we wanted to just update the information here to include the scores.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.610
Let's try and do that.

01:24.660 --> 01:33.490
To update we have the update table name and we have three rows which we don't want but for now I just

01:33.490 --> 01:36.150
want to show you we have update table name.

01:36.280 --> 01:46.410
And then we want to say set whichever column we want to equal a value, where the column equals some value.

01:46.510 --> 01:48.080
That looks confusing doesn't it.

01:49.890 --> 01:51.050
Let me show you what I mean.

01:51.420 --> 01:55.430
I can say UPDATE users and in the users

01:55.440 --> 02:02.820
I want to SET score column to equal what do we want it to equal.

02:02.820 --> 02:06.660
Let's say that we want Andrei to have a score of 50.

02:06.810 --> 02:14.890
We can say UPDATE users set score 50 WHERE which is another key word name

02:15.020 --> 02:20.900
equals 'Andrei'. It reads pretty nicely right.

02:20.930 --> 02:27.420
Update users set the score to 50 if the column name is Andrei.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.080
Looks like we got an update.

02:29.560 --> 02:39.940
If I now do select star from users, I see that I have Andrei with score 50.

02:40.380 --> 02:47.090
And you know what we also want to update Sally and John. But they both have the same score of let's say

02:47.330 --> 02:48.050
100.

02:48.140 --> 02:49.040
How can we do that.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.730
We can say UPDATE users SET score to

02:56.240 --> 03:17.880
100 WHERE name equals John but also we can say AND name equals Sally. If i press enter I get an update.

03:19.010 --> 03:21.510
If I go up to select users.

03:22.070 --> 03:25.870
You see that I did not get an update and that is because

03:25.880 --> 03:30.710
AND just like we did in javascript means that name should equal John and Sally.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.080
And we don't have that.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.200
It should be Sally or John.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.330
Right.

03:35.390 --> 03:45.030
So we can just press up to get our old command and change this to OR. We have 2 updates that just happened.

03:45.170 --> 03:49.390
And if I look up users look at that.

03:49.510 --> 03:55.390
I have Sally and John with score 100 and Andrei with 50. Looking at our GUI

03:55.450 --> 04:03.810
if I refresh, look at that we have our table with our new scores.

04:03.830 --> 04:05.220
Very cool.

04:05.300 --> 04:11.360
A few more commands that I want to show you in the next video, so I'll see you on that one.

04:11.350 --> 04:11.640
Bye-bye.
