00:00.340 --> 00:02.580
Welcome back! While you were gone

00:02.640 --> 00:06.080
Amy just joined our user base with a score of 88.

00:06.300 --> 00:07.600
Perfect.

00:07.650 --> 00:10.800
Now let's learn a few more SQL commands that are useful.

00:10.800 --> 00:18.350
What if I wanted to grab all users with names starting with 'A'. With SQL,

00:18.410 --> 00:20.140
it's super fast and super easy.

00:21.240 --> 00:36.690
We can simply say SELECT all FROM users WHERE name and this is a new one we're learning LIKE. And like

00:36.690 --> 00:38.460
allows us to add a condition.

00:38.820 --> 00:40.980
In our case we can say 'A'

00:41.310 --> 00:46.080
And then the percentage sign which means anything after a.

00:46.310 --> 00:50.880
If I click semi-colon and enter, look at that I get

00:50.890 --> 00:56.470
Andrei and Amy. Let's try this on our GUI as well.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.900
and show you what we can do.

00:59.110 --> 01:01.720
If I go over here, just copy and paste this.

01:08.820 --> 01:18.260
And if I change this to lowercase and run query, Well I don't get anything because it has to be uppercase

01:18.260 --> 01:18.490
right.

01:18.490 --> 01:21.600
We're searching for 'A'.

01:21.620 --> 01:23.140
There you go.

01:23.350 --> 01:30.730
Although with SQL our commands can be lowercase or uppercase when we do searches we want to make sure

01:30.730 --> 01:38.050
that the case matters and that is why mostly when we store information in databases we want to make

01:38.050 --> 01:39.820
sure that there is some consistency.

01:39.820 --> 01:47.520
So when we save this information such as inserting. Maybe in the server we lowercase everything so that

01:47.520 --> 01:49.610
we don't have this issue.

01:49.650 --> 01:52.410
What if I wanted to do all names ending in 'y'.

01:52.680 --> 01:58.110
If I do percentage y run query I get Sally and Amy. Amazing.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.160
Okay what if I want to do something different.

02:03.730 --> 02:07.510
Let's say I want to get everything sorted in order.

02:07.930 --> 02:10.660
Maybe from the highest score to the lowest score.

02:10.870 --> 02:19.750
Well we can select all from users and we can order by the column we want to order by.

02:19.850 --> 02:22.340
In our case it will be the score.

02:22.510 --> 02:28.620
And if we want to do ascending or descending- let's do descending first.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.370
And I spelled descending wrong.

02:30.370 --> 02:32.380
It's DESC.

02:32.740 --> 02:35.000
Press enter and look at that.

02:35.170 --> 02:47.090
I have Sally and John as the top score. If I do ascending ASC, I get low score Andrei, hmm.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.390
I'm not doing too well in this game.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.030
Very cool.

02:52.030 --> 02:53.770
Are you starting to see the power of SQL.

02:53.770 --> 03:00.370
Remember all the looping that we would have had to do if we had usernames. SQL is really

03:00.370 --> 03:03.140
really good at grabbing this information.

03:03.160 --> 03:09.820
You saw how fast this is even if this was hundreds of lines it will be really good at grabbing information,

03:10.120 --> 03:13.340
updating information, maybe ordering it.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.400
It is extremely powerful.

03:15.400 --> 03:22.060
Pretty much since the 1960s it's been just the language of choice for databases because it's so

03:22.060 --> 03:22.560
good.

03:24.940 --> 03:25.570
All right.

03:25.570 --> 03:26.330
Awesome.

03:26.650 --> 03:29.950
We're starting to learn more and more, a few more to go.

03:29.950 --> 03:31.030
I'll see you in the next one.

03:31.330 --> 03:31.990
Bye bye.
