00:00.750 --> 00:01.320
All right.

00:01.430 --> 00:10.700
So let's create a table. If you remember to go to our Postgres database we simply write psql

00:10.700 --> 00:14.980
then our database name and we'll enter the database.

00:15.130 --> 00:18.410
And now we can communicate with it using SQL.

00:18.430 --> 00:19.950
Now let's create a table.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.060
How can we do that.

00:21.940 --> 00:29.380
Again SQL comes with some language. Language syntax that we can use. And to create a table we can

00:29.380 --> 00:30.840
use something like this.

00:30.970 --> 00:34.580
We say 'CREATE TABLE' which is an SQL command.

00:34.870 --> 00:43.780
We enter a table name followed by brackets and then we say what we want the column_1 to say with

00:43.780 --> 00:52.940
the data type, column_2 with the data type, column_3 with the data type and then ending it with semicolon.

00:52.940 --> 00:56.010
Let me just press enter and see what happens here.

00:56.180 --> 01:05.030
I get an error 'type "datatype" does not exist' and that is because datatype is referring to what Postgres

01:05.060 --> 01:12.000
or our relational database knows, we have to say ahead of time what type of data

01:12.020 --> 01:14.400
column_1, column_2, and column_3 hold.

01:15.590 --> 01:23.030
If we go back to our Chrome browser we see that for Postgres we have a few data types that we can

01:23.030 --> 01:29.240
hold. String datatypes, numeric datatypes, and date and time datatypes.

01:29.360 --> 01:33.180
And each one of them have different things. For a numeric data type

01:33.230 --> 01:37.900
We have integer which is a 4 byte integer.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.980
We have bigint which allows for a bigger number and all these different things,

01:44.000 --> 01:49.870
we have money which is currency value and the reason we have to give this datatype is because of the

01:49.880 --> 01:57.080
way databases work. They're optimized to make sure that as long as everything is the same in their column

01:57.410 --> 02:00.840
they're able to work really really fast to perform actions.

02:02.190 --> 02:10.550
In our case let's use some of the most common ones. We can use text for the first column.

02:10.620 --> 02:11.370
So let's do that.

02:11.370 --> 02:16.110
I'm going to press the up arrow and get create table.

02:16.110 --> 02:21.300
I'm also going to name this table, let's call it users

02:24.000 --> 02:39.550
and column_1 will be name, datatype can be text, column_2 we can say that is age and datatype for an

02:39.550 --> 02:40.390
age.

02:40.390 --> 02:43.870
Well if we look down here we look at numeric types.

02:43.960 --> 02:49.920
We want to use something like smallint which is a 2-byte signed integer.

02:50.080 --> 02:56.320
It means that a max for a smallint, if I go to smallint Max

02:58.990 --> 03:04.820
we see that the max range is 32,762. Well nobody's going to be that

03:04.820 --> 03:05.530
old, right?

03:05.530 --> 03:14.160
So we can use smallint for now lets do that. I'm going to say age is smallint.

03:14.300 --> 03:24.140
And finally the third column will just have 'birthday' and birthday can be a date datatype and we can

03:24.140 --> 03:32.460
just have date let's press enter and I get create table.

03:32.610 --> 03:37.670
Let's look at our PSequel here. And I'll minimize this.

03:37.900 --> 03:48.190
And if I click refresh here I see that we have users. Look at that and we have columns for the table users

03:48.220 --> 03:50.470
that is name, age, birthday.

03:50.520 --> 03:53.110
It tells us the type and the length.

03:53.110 --> 03:56.320
So now we have our table. Awesome.

03:56.560 --> 04:06.700
There's also a way to do it here if we do '\d' I get list of relations and look at that we

04:06.700 --> 04:13.600
have our users table and the owner which is me, very Cool.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.210
There you go.

04:14.290 --> 04:20.620
We've created our first table. Now that we have this we can start entering some information.

04:20.620 --> 04:24.800
And by the way you might be asking how many times do we run these commands.

04:25.090 --> 04:30.490
Well ideally once you create your database and it lives somewhere on a computer somewhere in the world

04:31.540 --> 04:33.740
you only run this once, right.

04:33.910 --> 04:40.420
You create a table of what you want your database to look like and the rest is just filling in and inserting

04:40.420 --> 04:43.180
information and reading information off of it.

04:43.180 --> 04:49.510
So this is the command that we're going to set up when we create our own database to set up our schemas.

04:49.510 --> 04:52.470
And then after that it'll just run on its own.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.530
And It will be able to communicate with the back end.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.370
It's going to be very fun.

04:57.370 --> 05:00.560
By the way before we get into the next video I want to show you one more command.

05:00.580 --> 05:03.980
We learned the '\d' shows us our tables.

05:04.060 --> 05:12.480
If I do '\q' We exit out of here and we're back to the terminal.

05:12.490 --> 05:14.470
All right I'll see you in the next one.

05:14.860 --> 05:15.100
Bye-bye.
