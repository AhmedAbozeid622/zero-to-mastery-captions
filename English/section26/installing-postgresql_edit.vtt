00:02.130 --> 00:02.840
Welcome back.

00:02.910 --> 00:08.820
We're going to start setting up Postgres on our computer so that just like we did with servers in

00:08.830 --> 00:16.050
Front End we're going to have a terminal that's running our front end and a Back End that is running

00:16.050 --> 00:22.920
our server, but also another terminal that is running a database because as you remember these are just

00:22.920 --> 00:28.940
computers running somewhere. In the same way that we ran our server on our computer.

00:28.940 --> 00:31.810
We can also run our database on our computer.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.060
And in this video we're going to get us set up with Postgres. Now

00:36.260 --> 00:38.950
MongoDB has gotten popular,

00:39.040 --> 00:45.020
however nothing beats a relational database for really developing your knowledge of databases.

00:45.020 --> 00:52.130
Once you understand relational databases it gives you really really good tools and mental models to

00:52.130 --> 00:56.620
work with MongoDB. MongoDB is very, very simple.

00:56.750 --> 01:02.720
You can think of it as a JSON data structure where we just have JSON that looks like an object

01:03.080 --> 01:09.460
and we store that information there. With SQL and relational databases

01:09.470 --> 01:11.200
it's more complex than that.

01:11.210 --> 01:17.150
So if you understand this, you are miles ahead when it comes to understanding databases.

01:17.150 --> 01:23.720
So we're going to be focusing on that because the principles are still the same for MongoDB.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.050
All right.

01:24.100 --> 01:30.150
So let's get Postgres set up on our computer.

01:30.190 --> 01:34.890
The first thing we want to do is download something called a GUI.

01:34.900 --> 01:42.630
So a graphical user interface for Postgres. And this exists for pretty much any database out there.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.960
I like PSequel because it's free.

01:45.040 --> 01:49.090
It's really, really good for Mac and it's very light and simple.

01:49.090 --> 01:55.580
I'll also make sure to add notes on how to download something like this and Postgres in general

01:55.600 --> 02:02.360
if you're using a Windows machine. But otherwise just click on the download link, it will be completely

02:02.360 --> 02:03.090
fast.

02:03.110 --> 02:08.340
Just open it up and you'll have something like this that I'm going to be using throughout the course.

02:08.570 --> 02:11.130
But there's many, many options and you can take a look for it.

02:11.330 --> 02:14.800
You just search for PostgreSQL GUI.

02:15.380 --> 02:23.440
And once you have PSequel installed you'll have it in your application folder and you can follow along.

02:23.440 --> 02:29.020
Now let's go back to the terminal. In order to have Postgres installed - there's many, many ways and

02:29.020 --> 02:32.270
again I'll provide some notes on how you can do it.

02:32.530 --> 02:37.570
But the best way especially on Mac is to use Brew which we've already talked about.

02:37.690 --> 02:44.290
Every time you do something with homebrew- again it's a way to download packages from the Internet on

02:44.290 --> 02:45.360
your terminal.

02:45.370 --> 02:49.930
You always want to make sure that you do a brew update to make sure that everything is updated.

02:53.420 --> 02:59.780
And also a brew doctor which just makes sure everything is working on your system.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.350
Let's clear that. Perfect.

03:06.530 --> 03:12.530
Once you have that set up we're going to just say Brew install

03:15.040 --> 03:19.490
postgresql and this will install for us

03:19.670 --> 03:24.250
Postgres. And you see over here that I already have Postgres installed.

03:24.400 --> 03:30.130
But if it's your first time it'll run through the commands and then actually at the end tell you exactly

03:30.130 --> 03:31.650
how to start using it.

03:33.080 --> 03:37.370
But in our case I'll just tell you. It'll be much easier. To start Postgres.

03:37.400 --> 03:46.890
You need to do 'brew services start postgresql' and don't worry this isn't Postgres specific. Any database

03:46.920 --> 03:52.140
that you are downloading you're essentially downloading the software and then you want to start the service.

03:52.250 --> 03:58.520
Each one has its own commands but it's as simple as Googling and figuring out how to run the database.

03:58.520 --> 04:02.350
So we've started postgresql.

04:02.350 --> 04:02.940
It looks like

04:02.940 --> 04:12.740
I've already started the service and just to show you if I actually do stop here, it will stop the postgres

04:12.750 --> 04:13.380
service.

04:16.080 --> 04:24.510
And lets do start again and you can see that it's starting. Now in order for us to use Postgres we

04:24.510 --> 04:26.380
need to create a database.

04:26.660 --> 04:35.210
And the way we do that is to use the 'Createdb' command that has come once we've installed Postgres.

04:35.420 --> 04:37.100
And here we can call it whatever we want.

04:37.130 --> 04:40.790
So let's call it test.

04:40.910 --> 04:42.390
It's going to create the DB.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.740
And there you go. Here's the cool part

04:45.850 --> 04:53.060
if I go back to my PSequel, open this up. Let me close this.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.310
I have over here PSequel.

04:55.680 --> 05:00.040
And it asks for the host which is the link to where the database is located.

05:00.060 --> 05:04.230
In my case it's located at my localhost, right.

05:04.230 --> 05:07.740
It's running on my computer.

05:07.820 --> 05:10.790
So you want it to be localhost and the port number.

05:10.790 --> 05:13.950
This is the default port number of 5 4 3 2.

05:14.030 --> 05:19.270
Remember, how we had port 3000 and 3001 for the front end and backend.

05:19.340 --> 05:20.200
It's similar to that.

05:20.210 --> 05:22.950
It's opening up a port for it to listen to a database.

05:23.210 --> 05:27.720
And this is the standard port for Postgres that you'll see.

05:28.100 --> 05:35.960
So when I did the 'Start postgresql' and 'createdb' the default of '5432' was already set.

05:36.050 --> 05:38.830
I can actually set what ports and change it up.

05:39.020 --> 05:41.940
But we want to keep everything standard so we'll keep it the way it is.

05:43.620 --> 05:52.310
If I now go to the database and we called it 'test' so again we'll do test database hit connect.

05:52.330 --> 05:52.810
All right.

05:52.810 --> 05:58.900
We're connected to the database but there's not much in here is there.

05:59.140 --> 06:03.110
But at least we know that we're connected to localhost test.

06:03.210 --> 06:08.610
And another way to connect to this, remember this is a GUI- a graphical user interface and I'm showing

06:08.610 --> 06:12.840
you this because it's really good for demo purposes but I want you to get comfortable working with the

06:12.840 --> 06:17.990
terminal as well. In order to do the same thing we just did with the GUI,

06:18.260 --> 06:25.060
We can type in 'psql' again which is a command that we'll get when we install Postgres and we'll

06:25.110 --> 06:27.310
say which database we want to connect to.

06:27.390 --> 06:30.700
In our case *it will be the 'test'.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.210
And there you go.

06:32.390 --> 06:35.050
Just like when we run node and it changes terminals.

06:35.060 --> 06:42.670
Now we're inside of Postgres that's running on our computer but we don't know any commands yet, do

06:42.670 --> 06:43.930
we?

06:43.930 --> 06:49.510
So in the next video we're going to learn some SQL commands and finally create some tables in our

06:49.510 --> 06:51.100
Postgres database.

06:51.130 --> 06:52.780
I'll see in that one, bye-bye.
