Welcome back.

00:02.630 --> 00:08.870
Now SQL can also have functions and I'm going to show you three of the most popular, most common

00:08.870 --> 00:14.760
ones in this video. Just to check what we have in our table, well we have users.

00:14.910 --> 00:27.380
And if I do SELECT star users, oop. I forgot to use FROM, we have our users. Now let's say we wanted to get

00:27.470 --> 00:30.010
the average score of the users.

00:30.380 --> 00:41.300
We can do that by saying SELECT average and give the column name inside of average let's say score FROM

00:42.340 --> 00:44.210
users table.

00:44.470 --> 00:49.220
So you can see that our function just like in Javascript has the function name

00:49.220 --> 00:58.130
and then the brackets around the column that we want. Lets press enter and look at that average is

00:58.130 --> 01:00.100
84.5.

01:00.130 --> 01:01.450
Very cool.

01:01.450 --> 01:02.900
What other functions do we have.

01:03.100 --> 01:12.790
Let's say we wanted to get the sum of everybody's age.

01:12.990 --> 01:19.520
I can invoke the SUM function and find out that we have an accumulated sum of 132.

01:19.800 --> 01:26.400
And then finally there's also COUNT another useful one.

01:26.630 --> 01:34.740
And if we want to find out how many users we have in our database we can just say COUNT name and we have

01:35.070 --> 01:38.200
four active users with our game.

01:38.220 --> 01:41.040
All right we've got to work on that to increase that number.

01:41.100 --> 01:41.880
Perfect.

01:41.880 --> 01:49.080
There's a few more functions that you can use but these are probably the most common. You can already

01:49.080 --> 01:49.620
imagine

01:49.650 --> 01:55.690
some of the power that comes with these values. I'll see in the next one, bye-bye.
