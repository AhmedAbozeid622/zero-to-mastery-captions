00:00.690 --> 00:02.260
And welcome back.

00:02.270 --> 00:06.910
In this final video I want to show you what this course is all about what we're learning in this course

00:06.910 --> 00:09.670
and what we're going to be able to do at the end.

00:09.710 --> 00:16.010
You may have heard the term full-stack developer front-end developer, back-end developer. And looking at

00:16.010 --> 00:17.050
this diagram

00:17.060 --> 00:23.500
you start to recognize that you know, HTML, CSS Javascript you see React in there, we'll get to that,

00:23.500 --> 00:29.360
don't worry about it but that's what a front-end developer does. The front-end developer is the person

00:29.840 --> 00:37.190
who makes sure that, when we open up the browser and go to Google.com that we see Google, we see it

00:37.310 --> 00:44.270
nice and pretty laid out beautifully, has a search bar, essentially anything that a user sees, the

00:44.270 --> 00:51.550
front-end developer does. And that is using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and a few other tools.

00:51.650 --> 00:58.340
The back-end developer, that's a person that works with the server makes sure that when a browser speaks

00:58.340 --> 01:06.140
to it, it serves up those files and uses some technology such as Node.js, Express.js, which we're going

01:06.140 --> 01:11.690
to get into, and then that server is going to talk also to a database; again we haven't really discussed

01:11.690 --> 01:17.470
that too much but don't worry there's going to be a section on it and that's going to use PostgreSQL

01:17.480 --> 01:20.560
and we're actually going to be learning that as well.

01:20.570 --> 01:27.770
So we want to build you up as a full-stack developer to be able to work with all these technologies, so that

01:28.170 --> 01:31.970
everything revolving around a web application,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.160
you're able to build, so get excited.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.600
You're going to learn all of this.

01:35.600 --> 01:42.670
It looks overwhelming, but trust me, just like this How the Internet Works section it's all going to make

01:42.670 --> 01:43.420
sense.

01:43.810 --> 01:45.510
So I'll see the next one.

01:45.680 --> 01:45.880
Bye-bye.
