Welcome back.

00:02.510 --> 00:05.290
Now we have our tables here.

00:05.420 --> 00:16.960
But what if we wanted to delete something. Let's say Sally decides to- let's try that again.

00:18.770 --> 00:25.640
Let's say Sally wants to just not be part of this app anymore and she's going to remove her user. Well

00:25.850 --> 00:27.090
she can send a request.

00:27.110 --> 00:37.100
And on the back end we can simply do delete the table name users and then we say which user. Well we

00:37.150 --> 00:46.790
use the WHERE key word and here say name equals 'Sally', press enter.

00:46.890 --> 00:55.690
And with delete, we actually have to do delete FROM so delete FROM users WHERE name equals Sally.

00:56.370 --> 00:57.620
And we have one delete.

00:57.810 --> 01:05.420
If I do select star from users there you go,

01:05.420 --> 01:10.120
Sally's gone. All right I think we're done with this example.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.130
Let's delete these tables.

01:12.140 --> 01:22.570
How can we do that. We can just DROP table and say login, login has been removed and then DROP table

01:25.190 --> 01:28.660
users. If I

01:28.770 --> 01:31.410
look at what tables we have,

01:31.860 --> 01:36.330
we have no relations, no tables.

01:36.350 --> 01:37.400
All right.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.450
Good job getting this far.

01:39.470 --> 01:40.450
I'll see you in the next video, bye-bye.
