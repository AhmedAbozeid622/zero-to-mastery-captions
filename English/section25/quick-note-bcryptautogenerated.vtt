Hey everyone this is me from the future.

00:03.780 --> 00:09.720
Just letting you know that in the next video we're going to talk about this package called B crypt node

00:09.950 --> 00:11.590
j s.

00:11.720 --> 00:19.220
Now if you go to this page now in NPM you'll get a little warning here saying that this package has

00:19.220 --> 00:23.720
been deprecated and that they recommend you use something else.

00:23.720 --> 00:29.380
You either use B crypt or b crypt dot J Yes.

00:29.480 --> 00:35.720
Now both of these are implementations of something we're going to talk about which is B crypt and I'll

00:35.720 --> 00:41.930
link to this resource so you can actually find out about the difference one is in JavaScript.

00:41.930 --> 00:44.460
The other one is in C++.

00:44.660 --> 00:52.490
Another programming language however for this project because this is our own personal project we're

00:52.490 --> 00:55.710
going to use B crypt no J.S. still.

00:55.910 --> 01:01.530
And the reason I do this is because B crypt no Jesus was specifically created.

01:01.610 --> 01:10.670
So it works both on Mac and Linux as well as windows because with the other packages based on whatever

01:10.670 --> 01:14.940
your operating system is you might encounter some errors.

01:15.020 --> 01:22.190
So if you want you can use those packages especially when you have a real life app that stores user

01:22.190 --> 01:23.310
passwords.

01:23.420 --> 01:26.130
But in our case I want us to use B script.

01:26.150 --> 01:33.370
No J.S. because although it's no longer maintained that is it doesn't get any updates.

01:33.440 --> 01:38.570
It will guarantee that it works on all systems for this lesson.

01:39.840 --> 01:47.730
So I still recommend using B crypt no J.S. if you want later on you can upgrade or change the package

01:47.730 --> 01:49.380
to be crypt B crypt yes.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.930
Most of the time these will work.

01:51.930 --> 01:57.230
But I want to avoid anybody having issues so that we can get this project ready and deployed.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.370
I'll see in the next one by.
