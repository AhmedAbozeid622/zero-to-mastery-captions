When I teach students for the first time DOM manipulation and events it's always overwhelming.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.230
It takes a few tries to really get it.

00:10.320 --> 00:16.620
And one thing you may have noticed in the previous videos is that there were a lot of methods that you

00:16.620 --> 00:23.990
learned and the Dom has a lot of them but you constantly have to check and see if it was compatible

00:23.990 --> 00:26.450
with the browsers to make sure it works.

00:26.450 --> 00:33.860
So we used websites like can I use dot com to constantly check that we can use those properties.

00:33.860 --> 00:37.000
It was a tedious process a few years ago.

00:37.010 --> 00:43.320
The support for the selectors and DOM manipulation techniques were even worse.

00:43.400 --> 00:51.540
For example query selector now is all good but a few years ago only a few browsers have them.

00:51.560 --> 00:56.510
So what did people do if it was even worse than it is now.

00:56.970 --> 01:01.280
Well there was a library that was created that solved this huge problem.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.000
And that was jQuery.

01:05.060 --> 01:07.230
You might have heard of it.

01:07.290 --> 01:16.200
It's one of the most popular libraries for JavaScript. In 2006 J.A.G. was introduced to the Web development

01:16.200 --> 01:17.010
world.

01:17.040 --> 01:23.970
It was a library which means it's just JavaScript a JavaScript file run by a few people that added a

01:23.970 --> 01:27.660
little bit more to the language so you can do more things.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.140
You had more properties more functions.

01:31.140 --> 01:37.730
Its main goal was to make DOM manipulation easier and compatible with all browsers.

01:37.960 --> 01:41.820
So they took care of the hard work and browser compatibility issues.

01:41.830 --> 01:42.860
Isn't that nice of them?

01:43.940 --> 01:49.940
Let's check this W3C example of jQuery.

01:50.080 --> 01:59.860
You can see over here that they're loading a script tag with a CDN that is pointed at a jQuery minified

02:00.070 --> 02:05.860
JavaScript and jQuery is just this snippet of code.

02:05.970 --> 02:16.180
It always has the dollar sign document dot ready which means, when the document the DOM object is ready

02:16.230 --> 02:20.080
run this function and inside of it you are write all this

02:20.100 --> 02:20.940
jQuery.

02:21.150 --> 02:24.420
So in this case you can see that we want to select P.

02:24.420 --> 02:30.800
This was a jQuery specific syntax and on click run this function.

02:31.020 --> 02:34.940
So it was the exact same thing as when we did p

02:34.950 --> 02:44.340
Dot addEventListener and then we would do click and then do some sort of a function.

02:44.560 --> 02:51.610
So you can see it made things a little bit cleaner to do and you can do things like this dot hide.

02:51.690 --> 02:54.630
So if I click over here it hides.

02:54.780 --> 02:57.150
It hides it hides.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.360
That's pretty nice.

02:58.770 --> 03:01.960
But jQuery had a one issue.

03:02.110 --> 03:04.690
It made the code very imperative.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.600
And what does that mean?

03:06.700 --> 03:09.670
It's a word you're going to hear a lot when you become a developer.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.560
It means that you have to tell the program exactly what to do.

03:13.720 --> 03:21.160
One by one this may not seem like a bad idea but when your websites get big and complicated it creates

03:21.160 --> 03:22.550
a huge mess.

03:23.150 --> 03:30.140
One action is dependent on one action which is dependent on another action which is dependent on another

03:30.140 --> 03:30.830
action.

03:30.860 --> 03:33.730
Now you lose track of what is happening.

03:34.570 --> 03:40.420
More errors and more bugs into your codebase and it becomes really really complicated.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.490
Let me show you an example.

03:42.970 --> 03:50.320
We have a simple jQuery code here where we say again document ready function and then we're selecting

03:51.070 --> 03:54.990
article left section when the click happens.

03:55.000 --> 04:03.770
Then we check this has a class and we remove class and I mean this doesn't look that bad.

04:04.660 --> 04:12.100
But it got to a point where you had code like this called pyramid of Doom where if this happens you

04:12.100 --> 04:17.680
do this and if this happens you do this and if this happens you do this and you can imagine if there

04:17.680 --> 04:24.130
was another thing that was listening to another event that might have unexpected consequences because

04:24.250 --> 04:29.760
this is running and the user is at the same time interacting with the website.

04:29.830 --> 04:36.910
And you can see here how much of a mess it is I mean this is this is just an example but you can see

04:37.150 --> 04:38.850
that it's very imperative.

04:38.860 --> 04:45.940
This happens and do this and within it if that happens then do this and so on and so forth.

04:46.210 --> 04:49.520
It creates a big mess when you have big websites.

04:49.620 --> 04:55.810
jQuery was great at the time he made JavaScript really popular because it was finally easy to make interactive

04:55.840 --> 04:58.140
websites and it did a lot of great things for the industry.

04:58.140 --> 05:03.380
However as time progressed people found new and better ways to do things.

05:03.550 --> 05:08.450
Web browsers adapted new things like querySelector.

05:08.740 --> 05:19.330
And we even have a website now that compares what you can do with simple JavaScript and HTML and what

05:19.570 --> 05:23.860
you can do with jQuery and most of the things you can do both.

05:23.860 --> 05:29.850
And it's not that different as time progressed people found new and better ways to do things.

05:30.730 --> 05:36.070
You still have jQuery being used today but there are fewer and fewer people starting projects that

05:36.070 --> 05:38.010
are using jQuery right now.

05:38.200 --> 05:43.300
As a matter of fact the number of job postings with jQuery as a requirement has really gone down

05:43.300 --> 05:50.130
and there's rather a negative view of developers who only know jQuery this is not to bash a library.

05:50.130 --> 05:52.380
It was an important part of JavaScript growth.

05:52.740 --> 05:56.340
But in 2018 it isn't that useful of a skill.

05:56.340 --> 06:04.150
That is why in this course we are learning React. React is a library that solves the huge problem of

06:04.150 --> 06:04.960
jQuery.

06:04.990 --> 06:11.650
Instead of being imperative it's declarative. We will get into more of the benefits and what that means

06:12.130 --> 06:13.520
when we get to the section.

06:13.780 --> 06:21.000
But having a historical perspective of where we were and where we are now is important.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.130
So remember this.

06:23.470 --> 06:27.760
First we had HTML, then CSS and JavaScript.

06:28.030 --> 06:31.360
Then came jQuery to make our JavaScript easier.

06:31.360 --> 06:36.540
Then came more libraries that made JavaScript even more fun and easy to work with.

06:37.490 --> 06:42.320
From now on we won't be using DOM manipulation techniques we have learned in this section.

06:42.320 --> 06:46.250
Bummer. I know but I'll show you what we can do better.

06:46.310 --> 06:47.620
So stay tuned.

06:47.620 --> 06:49.760
It gets way more fun after this.

06:50.390 --> 06:52.280
I'll see you in the next one. Bye bye.
