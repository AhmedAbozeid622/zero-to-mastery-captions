00:01.070 --> 00:11.070
Welcome back. So far we've taken a look at how Javascript interacts with HTML and CSS and we've

00:11.070 --> 00:18.390
seen that we've been able to change text, change styles and interact with our Web page.

00:18.620 --> 00:21.350
In this video we're going to try something fun.

00:21.410 --> 00:26.780
We're going to have an exercise where we're going to create a background generator so that for our future

00:26.780 --> 00:34.660
projects we can have a nice awesome gradient for our backgrounds.

00:34.770 --> 00:39.670
We're going to use just a few lines of Javascript to create this.

00:39.790 --> 00:40.830
So let's get started.

00:42.760 --> 00:46.460
All right we have a beautiful blank canvas here.

00:46.540 --> 00:53.080
Open up the console so that as we write code make sure we don't make any errors and we're going to start

00:53.080 --> 00:55.420
off with a simple HTML file.

00:56.690 --> 01:05.780
We'll call it gradient background and within the body we'll have a few things we'll have in each one

01:06.410 --> 01:18.560
that will say background generator and we'll also have an H2 that will say current CSS background

01:22.020 --> 01:29.790
and we'll have an H3 that will be blank for now because we're going to be putting the CSS style so

01:29.790 --> 01:34.250
that people can copy and paste that background gradient from right in here.

01:34.410 --> 01:42.630
And obviously we need Javascript so we'll add a script tag and we'll do source equals the script dot JS.

01:42.810 --> 01:50.000
Yes let's refresh Now I want to show you two cool things that comes with HTML and CSS.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.780
The first is the input type color.

01:57.690 --> 02:02.630
And the second is CSS's linear gradient.

02:08.430 --> 02:13.330
So CSS3 has these cool gradient backgrounds that we can do.

02:13.390 --> 02:21.640
So we'll use this syntax to create our gradient and for the color picker we'll use the HTML type

02:22.030 --> 02:27.850
color for the input to get a color picker so we can do that fairly quick.

02:27.850 --> 02:40.500
Let's go right below the H2 and we'll create an input and the type will be color name will be color

02:40.600 --> 02:48.180
1 and we can actually also give it a default value so we'll do value and we'll just put it in a random

02:49.050 --> 02:51.030
HEX color will do

02:51.040 --> 02:57.720
00ff00. And we want to have two color pickers because the way gradients work it

02:57.720 --> 03:00.490
goes from one color to the other.

03:00.510 --> 03:05.070
So we'll put another color picker will save.

03:05.240 --> 03:16.510
Change the name to color2 this time this color will have more red and refresh and there you go.

03:16.540 --> 03:19.400
We have our color pickers.

03:20.580 --> 03:21.840
Now the one thing I want to show you.

03:21.840 --> 03:27.940
I created a style sheet that I'll provide for you that will have some default style so it looks really

03:27.940 --> 03:28.950
really good.

03:29.380 --> 03:38.080
And we can include that in our HTML file will say Link style

03:38.210 --> 03:41.610
CSS and if I refresh.

03:42.210 --> 03:51.390
Well we got an awesome background with our cool font and everything centered just show you quickly what

03:51.390 --> 03:54.330
made the background have this gradient.

03:54.330 --> 04:03.390
All I did was have the background linear gradient and you go to and then give it a direction we want

04:03.390 --> 04:08.510
to go to the right and we give it the starting color and the ending color.

04:08.820 --> 04:11.620
So that's the default color that we have.

04:11.670 --> 04:15.750
The rest is all just font and text aligning.

04:15.750 --> 04:22.290
So nothing too crazy nothing that you can't do yourself but the one thing that we need is this needs to

04:22.290 --> 04:23.410
be interactive.

04:23.430 --> 04:30.080
If I pick a color here well I want to change same for this one.

04:30.680 --> 04:37.940
And ideally if I find a background that are really really light for my app I can print it out over here

04:37.940 --> 04:43.000
so I can just copy and paste the linear gradient and use that.

04:43.010 --> 04:43.840
So let's work on that.

04:48.030 --> 04:49.640
What do we know so far?

04:49.640 --> 04:55.630
We know that Javascript can read from the DOM and it can affect it.

04:55.880 --> 05:02.890
So we want to read what the value what the colors are of both inputs.

05:04.030 --> 05:10.840
And we want to put out a piece of text at the bottom here with those values in the CSS format.

05:11.050 --> 05:21.620
So it looks like we'll need to select two inputs and then also select the H3 so we can enter some text

05:21.620 --> 05:32.610
here. Let's go to the script JS file and the first thing we want to do is we want to select the H3.

05:33.100 --> 05:43.670
So all of our CSS equals document dot querySelector and because there's only one H3 we can

05:43.670 --> 05:47.510
just select H3. OK.

05:47.510 --> 05:56.490
We also want to select the colors and we should give it a class to so we can distinguish them.

05:56.530 --> 06:12.270
So I'm going to say a class equals color1 and the other one will have class color2.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.040
So now we can do variable color1

06:15.190 --> 06:24.790
equals document querySelector and we'll do color1.

06:24.870 --> 06:32.880
Again it's a querySelector. So we do classSelector just like we do in CSS and for color2 we do the

06:32.880 --> 06:33.820
same thing.

06:41.850 --> 06:43.040
This looks good for now.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.890
We ideally grab all these

06:46.010 --> 06:48.650
and our background should change.

06:48.650 --> 06:53.210
Let's check everything and make sure that we are correct.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.050
And what have you done so far.

07:03.170 --> 07:05.810
Let's refresh the page and there you go.

07:05.810 --> 07:12.420
We have our H3 that's where we're going to want to have our CSS text for our background.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.920
We have our inputs.

07:14.270 --> 07:16.150
The first one and the second one.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.750
OK it looks like we're doing everything right.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.220
Now what do we want to happen?

07:22.240 --> 07:30.090
We want to listen to an event where we notice the user's actions here.

07:30.210 --> 07:38.370
We've learned about click and mouse center and key press.

07:38.370 --> 07:41.810
But this isn't really any of those is it?

07:41.830 --> 07:49.610
Well there is a really really good event for inputs and it's called input.

07:49.680 --> 07:55.700
So any time the input value changes which it does every time we change the color we can detect it.

07:57.630 --> 08:00.810
So let's think about how we would do this.

08:00.810 --> 08:07.580
We want to have color1 to have an event listener.

08:11.110 --> 08:20.020
That will have input and you will have a function that for now we can just console dot log

08:20.030 --> 08:22.980
color1 dot value.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.290
Now we also want the second color to have the same thing.

08:28.510 --> 08:34.530
But for color2. Let's refresh and check here we remove the console logs because we don't need any

08:34.530 --> 08:39.460
more refresh and let's see. Look at that.

08:39.550 --> 08:41.320
You see them in the console.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.940
This is getting updated.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.290
That's pretty cool.

08:44.290 --> 08:45.730
All right so the first one's working.

08:45.730 --> 08:51.260
The second one now it's working too. Awesome.

08:51.290 --> 08:54.480
So we're grabbing the colors, the color of value.

08:54.530 --> 08:57.680
What do we want to do next with this value.

08:59.570 --> 09:02.780
Well we want to change the background color.

09:03.720 --> 09:12.400
And how can we do that? Well the background if we right click and do inspect.

09:12.570 --> 09:17.340
You make this bigger this bigger.

09:17.470 --> 09:25.230
We see that the background is in the body tag so ideally we change this.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.830
Let's go back to the console.

09:30.010 --> 09:35.170
Minimize this and let's try and change the background now with the information that we have.

09:35.250 --> 09:39.700
Any time color1 changes we want to grab the background's tag.

09:39.750 --> 09:46.560
Well again we can say body equals document dot get...

09:49.230 --> 09:52.390
getElementBy and let's have an Id here.

09:52.770 --> 09:53.820
Well say Id

09:56.750 --> 10:07.150
gradient and we can say get elementById and we'll say gradient.

10:07.350 --> 10:10.310
Again we want to make sure that we're actually selecting it.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.180
So let's try

10:15.320 --> 10:17.430
body and refresh.

10:17.860 --> 10:25.750
All right we're getting the body tag and if we remember we can change the style of the body by doing

10:27.310 --> 10:30.350
style dot background. That's

10:30.620 --> 10:34.620
a CSS property and we can just say red. see if that works.

10:35.630 --> 10:36.030
Great.

10:36.030 --> 10:42.000
We're changing the color to red but that doesn't look as good as great but at least now we know how

10:42.000 --> 10:53.340
to change this so we can say when the first input changes, body dot background or style dot background

10:56.320 --> 11:03.270
equals linear gradient to right.

11:04.210 --> 11:06.740
And there's just the syntax you'll have to get used to.

11:08.040 --> 11:14.520
And we'll say the first color will be color1 dot value and we'll need a comma for that.

11:14.760 --> 11:23.080
And the second value will be inside a space here color2 value.

11:23.250 --> 11:32.650
So that's the second color picker and we'll say plus close the bracket and the CSS and it should be good

11:32.650 --> 11:33.360
to go.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.550
And I put this on a new line just so you can see it.

11:42.390 --> 11:48.080
Perfect and again javascript doesn't see the semicolons here so it just keeps reading line by line.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.850
OK so let's save and see if we did that right.

11:50.850 --> 11:54.730
I'm going to refresh and actually you don't need a semicolon here.

11:54.810 --> 11:56.510
So let's see if that works.

11:56.640 --> 12:05.160
I'm going to refresh select the first one and look at that and get ourself the gradient working.

12:05.440 --> 12:10.760
But obviously we need to do the second one as well because right now is just console logging.

12:11.150 --> 12:23.620
Again let's do the same thing into the second color picker I save and refresh you picked the first one

12:25.510 --> 12:28.390
and we pick the next one.

12:28.410 --> 12:29.560
Look at that.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.510
That's really pretty.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.710
But that should have triggered something.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.090
We just copy and pasted the same lines of code.

12:37.210 --> 12:43.790
And if we remember that's a big problem because dry. Do not repeat yourself.

12:44.080 --> 12:49.750
So how can we extract this function so that it's a lot cleaner?

12:49.940 --> 13:01.800
Very easy we can create a function and we'll say set the gradient and set gradient well, as the name

13:01.800 --> 13:06.780
suggests set our beautiful gradient.

13:06.790 --> 13:17.590
So now this function can just be called setGradient and same for the second color.

13:17.680 --> 13:23.550
I can say setGradient look how much cleaner that looks.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.850
Well let's see if everything still works.

13:25.910 --> 13:28.590
I'm going to refresh.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.210
I'm going to select.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.190
And looks like we broke something.

13:33.630 --> 13:34.810
See what we did here.

13:35.680 --> 13:40.570
This event of input gets triggered automatically and runs a function.

13:41.550 --> 13:51.210
We don't need to call the function because this input event is triggered automatically and the second

13:51.210 --> 13:55.680
parameter automatically gets ran with the event.

13:55.680 --> 14:06.610
So now if I save this select one everything works again just to reiterate. If we had called the functions

14:06.610 --> 14:07.360
like these.

14:07.570 --> 14:15.400
The first pass through when the HTML documents loaded it reads the script file and it goes through the

14:15.400 --> 14:16.230
lines.

14:16.640 --> 14:23.480
And when we have the event listener we also set the gradient.

14:23.760 --> 14:29.930
But we want this to be called every time the input is selected.

14:29.940 --> 14:37.840
So again our function is now like this and we have ourself

14:40.620 --> 14:42.950
beautiful background generator.

14:43.190 --> 14:48.800
We're actually going to use this when we design our final project because well I think the backgrounds

14:48.800 --> 14:50.270
look pretty cool with this.

14:51.910 --> 14:52.760
Very cool.

14:53.080 --> 14:57.250
And you see how easier that was fairly fast

14:57.250 --> 14:59.060
Just a few lines of code.

14:59.350 --> 15:07.180
I want to show you one last thing and that is we've been using addEventListener which is the recommended

15:07.180 --> 15:14.440
way of doing things because we're keeping the Javascript and the Javascript file but we could have also

15:14.440 --> 15:24.560
done within the input an onclick attribute or oninput attribute.

15:26.330 --> 15:35.250
So within here I could have said, because we have this available to us setGradient I could have said

15:37.290 --> 15:47.390
setGradient and also on the second one we would do setGradient

15:50.360 --> 15:51.730
so we'll see if this works.

15:51.760 --> 15:57.520
If I comment these out so I never had the event listener and I refresh

16:00.130 --> 16:01.510
see that it still changes.

16:05.570 --> 16:11.850
What is the difference between doing this and doing it this way?

16:13.510 --> 16:21.320
Well the difference is that here we're adding Javascript to HTML against separation of concerns.

16:21.490 --> 16:28.550
And also you can see here that we can only add setGradient.

16:28.630 --> 16:40.150
So this input can only have one oninput attribute versus here where we can keep adding different functions

16:40.160 --> 16:41.250
different events.

16:41.480 --> 16:49.010
So this is a lot more extensible but I wanted to show you that you can do that and you can do an

16:49.010 --> 16:52.350
onclick function is just an HTML specifications.

16:52.550 --> 16:59.360
When we get to the React section you'll see that it has its own way of doing these type of events.

17:01.170 --> 17:08.030
So again I'm going to restore that refresh back to our beautiful Website.

17:08.060 --> 17:14.550
There is one other thing that we need to do and that is we need to have the CSS at the bottom right here.

17:14.910 --> 17:16.460
That's very easy to do.

17:16.500 --> 17:24.630
We can just say CSS dot textContent which is new.

17:24.630 --> 17:33.110
You haven't seen it before. But you can just say body dot style dot background and we'll add the

17:33.160 --> 17:34.070
semicolons.

17:35.190 --> 17:36.570
If I save and refresh

17:40.360 --> 17:43.410
look at that. As we pick the gradient

17:46.060 --> 17:54.060
we have this updating.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.350
Now a few questions you may have one.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.450
What is this textContent thing?

17:58.500 --> 18:03.310
Up until now I've shown you innerHTML.

18:03.800 --> 18:18.070
I also showed you createTextNode and now we have textContent like there's so many things to remember.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.960
What is it?

18:19.990 --> 18:28.870
It adds a text content as you can see there's many many ways to add things to the DOM.

18:29.440 --> 18:35.950
And the reason I did this is because I wanted to show you the frustration that a lot of people had an

18:36.340 --> 18:39.330
early 2000s when working with the DOM.

18:39.390 --> 18:47.080
And in the next video I'm going to talk about some of those issues and what we did to resolve that. And

18:47.110 --> 18:52.210
eventually when we would get into React we'll see that we actually won't be using any of these because

18:52.660 --> 19:00.580
React has extracted all of these out for us so that it's a lot simpler than figuring out how to enter

19:00.580 --> 19:09.780
text content adding event listeners and all this stuff that can get frankly pretty frustrating at times.

19:09.780 --> 19:10.830
That's it for now.

19:11.770 --> 19:14.690
Let's see what else you can add onto this background.

19:14.710 --> 19:21.400
I'll leave the code for you in the next section so you can play around with it and make it even better

19:21.400 --> 19:23.230
than it is right now.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.460
I'll see you in the next one.

19:24.610 --> 19:25.090
Bye bye.
