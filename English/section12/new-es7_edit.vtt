ES7 which was introduced in 2016, is very very easy to grasp.

00:06.990 --> 00:07.730
Why?

00:07.920 --> 00:12.400
Well, because unlike ES6 which had a lot of changes.

00:12.570 --> 00:17.390
ES7 only has two additions to the language. In this video,

00:17.400 --> 00:26.530
I'll go through both of them. The first one, we're going to talk about is the 'includes' method 

00:26.590 --> 00:29.050
that was added on strings and arrays.

00:29.070 --> 00:29.770
Let me show you.

00:30.590 --> 00:44.350
I can do something like "'Hellooooo'.includes", And I can say, 'o' and if it includes 'o', I'll get a true.

00:46.130 --> 00:49.160
We can also use it on arrays.

00:49.160 --> 01:03.720
So for example, if I had an array, let's call it 'pets' and in the 'pets' I have a 'cat', 'dog' and a 'bat'

01:03.810 --> 01:04.870
I know that's a weird pet.

01:04.890 --> 01:08.670
But sure there's some bats pets out there.

01:08.730 --> 01:09.310
All right.

01:09.420 --> 01:14.900
And now in here, if I do 'pets.includes('dog')'.

01:15.270 --> 01:27.440
Well, if I run this, in the console, I get true, if I do 'pets.includes('bird')', I'll get false because it

01:27.440 --> 01:30.370
doesn't include bird.

01:30.650 --> 01:31.630
Very simple.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.140
That's it.

01:32.170 --> 01:33.280
That's one of them.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.690
And then the second one is the exponential operator.

01:37.730 --> 01:44.740
So if I wanted to have a function that let's say 'square' something, I can do

01:47.350 --> 01:56.590
function 'x' is 'x star star 2' and that means 'x' to the power of two.

01:57.080 --> 02:04.860
So again, if I run this and then I do 'square' of two.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.350
Oh! and I cannot spell.

02:06.390 --> 02:09.100
Let's try that again, 'square' two.

02:09.470 --> 02:10.320
I get four.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.160
I do 'square' of five.

02:13.620 --> 02:15.250
I get 25.

02:15.510 --> 02:20.040
If I wanted to expand on this and do a 'cube',

02:22.730 --> 02:27.670
Well I can do 'cube', will have 3, exponential 3.

02:27.840 --> 02:40.590
So again and by clearing this, just to make a bit of space and I do 'cube' of three, I get 27, 'cube' of 4 is 64

02:41.460 --> 02:42.710
and that's it.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.700
Isn't that nice?

02:43.710 --> 02:50.040
ECMAScript is going to be releasing small incremental changes every year, so it it's easy to stay on

02:50.040 --> 02:56.250
top of language and avoid scenarios like ES6 where all of these changes were made and people had a hard

02:56.250 --> 02:58.320
time learning all of them.

02:58.430 --> 03:01.640
Now, with these simple two things in your tool belt,

03:01.640 --> 03:05.170
go and practice them and see you in the next video.

03:05.180 --> 03:05.450
Buh-bye.
