00:01.010 --> 00:09.890
Up to this point we learned the 'if' statement, the 'if else' statement and the 'else if' statement 

00:09.890 --> 00:17.660
And if you remember our section outline, well we haven't mentioned these two for javascript conditionals. 

00:17.660 --> 00:19.660
So we're going to tackle those today.

00:20.060 --> 00:24.190
As you can see we have two more to get through but don't be scared.

00:24.290 --> 00:27.360
These are not going to introduce anything new.

00:27.360 --> 00:33.170
There are just different ways of doing control flow but they won't do anything that a simple if else

00:33.330 --> 00:34.560
statement can't do.

00:34.940 --> 00:43.790
However there are cases where it will be much easier to do these two then if we do something with the

00:43.790 --> 00:45.490
'if else' statement.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.330
So let's check them out.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.870
The first thing we're going to talk about is the 'ternary operator'.

00:50.870 --> 00:54.950
It looks something like this,

00:55.480 --> 00:56.150
'condition ?'

00:58.740 --> 01:02.310
expression one (expr1) or expression two (expr2).

01:06.230 --> 01:10.820
And that is the syntax. It says, Is this true or false?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.790
If it's true then provide this value (expr1).

01:15.170 --> 01:17.870
If it's false provide this value(expr2).

01:18.230 --> 01:27.260
Let me show you an example of this, will have a function called 'isUserValid' that accepts a boolean (bool)

01:29.570 --> 01:34.190
and will just return the boolean value.

01:36.190 --> 01:48.670
Now within here we can say variable answer equals 'isUserValid' 

01:48.670 --> 01:50.090
and we'll say 'true' for now question mark(?)

01:50.290 --> 01:54.820
So if that's true I'll say 'You may enter'

01:58.300 --> 02:03.630
otherwise I'll say 'Access denied'

02:03.850 --> 02:06.600
Let me make this a little bit smaller so you can see.

02:06.820 --> 02:12.790
So again all we're saying is if this is true then do this expression("You may enter")

02:12.790 --> 02:15.960
If this is false do this expression("Access Denied").

02:16.110 --> 02:19.300
So just copy this into the console and see what happens.

02:21.520 --> 02:27.780
If I run 'anwer', Whoops I spell that wrong, 'answer'.

02:28.790 --> 02:33.570
I get, 'You may enter' because

02:33.580 --> 02:34.600
user is valid (isUserValid) is true.

02:34.640 --> 02:47.030
Now if I changed this to say 'false', well in that case I'll get 'Access denied'

02:47.030 --> 02:49.040
Let's do a little bit more of a complicated answer.

02:49.100 --> 02:58.870
We can say variable (var) 'automatedAnswer' and we can say and I'll do this on a new line just so you can see

02:59.050 --> 03:08.880
'Your account number is', 'isUserValid' and we'll just say something like.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.140
'false' for now.

03:10.140 --> 03:16.680
So because we have these brackets we're gonna have an expression inside of here that we can evaluate

03:16.680 --> 03:18.990
so we can say is user (isUserValid) is valid.

03:19.020 --> 03:23.280
If the user is valid will say '1234'.

03:23.420 --> 03:28.940
If not, we'll say 'not available'.

03:31.780 --> 03:37.830
If we copy and paste this here, into our console and we can see it better.

03:37.870 --> 03:39.880
We see, if user is valid (true)

03:39.880 --> 03:42.610
We want to say '1234'.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.070
If it's not then 'not available'.

03:45.070 --> 03:54.490
So if I run this and now I look at automated answer, I get 'Your account number is not available' well,

03:54.700 --> 03:56.920
because this user value is 'false'.

03:56.920 --> 04:08.190
But if I do 'true' well in that case your account number is '1234'.

04:08.210 --> 04:14.120
Now you might notice that this is actually not that different from if you did,

04:14.120 --> 04:18.170
'function condition' was called a condition and will say

04:21.600 --> 04:27.260
'if isUserValid' return.

04:27.290 --> 04:28.490
'You may enter'

04:31.510 --> 04:33.670
and you did 'else'

04:36.450 --> 04:55.330
'return Access denied' this function over here, 'condition', if I say variable(var) 'answer2' equals 'condition'.

04:55.570 --> 04:56.790
Let's see what happens.

04:59.380 --> 05:09.680
Copy these two, run them, and now if I look at the 'answer' I get 'You may enter' if I get the 'answer2'

05:09.690 --> 05:13.120
I get 'You may enter'.

05:13.290 --> 05:18.280
Now it's the exact same thing other than well bit of mis-spelling on my part.

05:19.630 --> 05:28.710
But you see that one way is a lot nicer, It's just nice simple one line. A ternary operator is really really

05:28.710 --> 05:36.060
good for these 'if else' where there is a check for a condition and there's two possible expressions, 

05:36.060 --> 05:36.790
that come out of it.

05:38.410 --> 05:44.350
All right let's learn, the next one, which is the 'switch' statement.

05:45.390 --> 05:46.290
This is the fun one.

05:47.350 --> 05:49.750
So a s'witch' statement looks something like this.

05:49.770 --> 05:53.980
And we can build a simple game right now to demonstrate how it works.

05:54.070 --> 05:58.720
I can say function 'moveCommand'.

05:59.350 --> 06:05.120
And we'll say it accepts parameter 'direction' within this function.

06:05.130 --> 06:12.790
I'll say variable(var) 'whatHappens' and we'll say 'switch'.

06:12.810 --> 06:13.850
Notice that it's a key word.

06:13.850 --> 06:16.140
So it's now highlighted in red.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.000
And I'll say 'direction'.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.790
The 'switch' statement is gonna accept 'direction' it's going to check 'direction'.

06:25.430 --> 06:37.600
And within here we'll say 'case' 'forward' which means check 'direction' if 'direction' equals 'forward',

06:37.820 --> 06:42.410
Then 'whatHappens' equals

06:42.900 --> 06:45.210
'You encounter a monster;'

06:48.490 --> 06:49.360
'break;'.

06:49.390 --> 06:54.750
I'll explain more 'break' does right after I finish up the rest of the case statements.

06:54.790 --> 07:01.210
So case statements as you can see are really good because I can just copy and paste.

07:01.470 --> 07:14.550
And now I can say for here we'll say 'back' and if direction is 'back' we'll say 'You arrived home' if the

07:14.550 --> 07:29.320
direction is 'right' in that case we'll say 'You found a river' and if the 'direction' is 'left' we'll say 

07:30.670 --> 07:34.050
'You run into a troll'.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.930
And then finally we'll say 'default'

07:43.330 --> 07:49.840
'whatHappens' equals to 'please enter a valid direction'.

07:52.740 --> 07:58.530
And we'll end it with a 'return' 'whatHappens'.

07:58.530 --> 07:58.950
All right.

07:58.950 --> 08:01.170
That was a whole lot of code.

08:01.170 --> 08:06.080
Let's run this command first and then we'll explain exactly what is happening.

08:06.090 --> 08:07.030
Copy the code.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.160
Copy into the console.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.760
And now we have the 'moveCommand'

08:11.840 --> 08:21.940
And if you remember the last video 'moveCommand' now exists in the root scope which is window, 

08:21.940 --> 08:22.300
so within here.

08:22.330 --> 08:31.860
Let's just say 'forward', now if I run this I get, 'You encountered a monster'.

08:32.030 --> 08:36.640
If I go 'back', 'You arrived home'.

08:36.640 --> 08:40.320
If I go 'right', 'You found a river'.

08:40.690 --> 08:46.830
If I go 'left', 'You run into a troll' and if I write jibberish

08:50.700 --> 08:51.070
I get.

08:51.090 --> 08:53.000
'Please enter a valid direction'.

08:53.980 --> 08:58.510
That's what switch statements are really good for when you have a lot of conditions.

08:58.510 --> 09:07.470
Instead of using an 'if else', 'if else', 'if else', 'if else', 'if else' statement, you can use a 'switch' statement

09:08.070 --> 09:10.710
and you can see, it reads nicely.

09:10.710 --> 09:16.760
Essentially what it's saying is create variable 'whatHappens' then switch.

09:16.770 --> 09:23.660
I want you to check whatever the condition is, whatever the variable is, in this case that's the direction.

09:23.970 --> 09:30.190
And in case, the direction equals 'forward' do this, in case direction is 'back' do this.

09:30.240 --> 09:33.810
If it's 'right' do this, if it's 'left' do this.

09:33.810 --> 09:42.060
And it says 'default' is if none of these conditions work and remember the program goes line by line

09:42.060 --> 09:46.260
so it checks 'forward' then it checks 'back' and it checks 'right' and the checks 'left'.

09:46.280 --> 09:53.940
And if nothing of those match then it says you can just default to 'please enter a valid direction' and

09:53.940 --> 09:59.700
then we return 'whatHappenes' so that was so that the function returns something for us.

09:59.710 --> 10:05.460
Now finally what is the 'break' well the 'break'(s) simply says,

10:06.850 --> 10:12.260
If 'case' is 'forward' then assign 'you encounter a monster' to

10:12.280 --> 10:18.620
'whatHhappens' variable and then 'break', 'break' is just saying break out of the switch statement.

10:18.640 --> 10:24.720
So instead of the program then checking to see if 'case' is 'back', 'case' is 'right', 'case' is 'left' or 'default'.

10:24.850 --> 10:33.550
If we say 'break', the program stops here and then goes straight out of the switch statement

10:33.910 --> 10:34.870
to return 'whatHappens'.

10:35.140 --> 10:46.830
So if I actually do, 'break' before 'whatHappens', 'you encounter a monster' and I copy this

10:49.680 --> 10:58.820
and let's rerun the function, we'll say 'moveCommand' is 'forward' notice what happens now.

10:59.840 --> 11:06.930
I get 'undefined' because we broke the program enters saying, Oh yeah!

11:07.320 --> 11:14.010
He typed in 'forward' but before we're able to assign something to the variable I say 'break', 

11:14.040 --> 11:21.530
I exit out of the switch statement and I return 'whatHappens' which it's only been declared but it's unassigned.

11:21.530 --> 11:26.630
So I just return 'undefined'.

11:26.680 --> 11:32.530
All right there you have it, your two other conditionals and you've covered all of them in javascript.

11:32.530 --> 11:39.710
Now each one is good for its own individual case but they're all very useful.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.470
I'll see you in the next one 
Buh-bye.
