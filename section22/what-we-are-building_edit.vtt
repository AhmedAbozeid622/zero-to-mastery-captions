00:01.100 --> 00:04.090
This is the most exciting part of the course.

00:04.250 --> 00:08.670
And I'm really, really excited to work on this project with you.

00:08.690 --> 00:14.810
We're going to be creating our final app, something that we can put in our portfolios and impress our

00:14.810 --> 00:18.000
future employers.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.410
We're going to use everything we've learned, up to this point.

00:21.680 --> 00:27.650
And then some later on, to create a full app that has a front end using react.

00:27.650 --> 00:30.340
It uses an image recognition API.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.530
It has its own server, using node and express.

00:34.610 --> 00:36.910
And then finally its database as well.

00:36.980 --> 00:46.780
We're going to be creating something where you can sign in.

00:46.870 --> 00:52.670
We will have a fully responsive web site as you can see it looks pretty nice.

00:53.560 --> 01:00.010
But the cool part is, other than all these fancy animations and the sign out ability that we have, when

01:00.010 --> 01:11.450
we enter an image and press detect, they'll actually detect faces and then images,

01:11.450 --> 01:11.910
and put a box around it.

01:12.230 --> 01:13.730
Let's try another one.

01:13.730 --> 01:26.750
If I select this face, all we need is a URL to an image, and look at that, it detects the face for us.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.890
So yes, you're going to build this. I'm going to help you out.

01:29.970 --> 01:37.530
And by the end of this, we'll have a fully finished project. And don't worry for those that just love

01:37.620 --> 01:41.190
watching, I'll provide the project files for you,

01:41.190 --> 01:43.710
at the end of this course.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.050
Are you excited?

01:45.440 --> 01:46.500
Well, let's get started.
