Hi welcome to The Complete Web Developer in 2018 the only course you will need to become a full stack

00:09.810 --> 00:12.900
developer and get hired.

00:12.920 --> 00:17.950
My name is Andrei Neagoie and I'll be taking you through this journey.

00:18.020 --> 00:23.930
I'm a senior software developer and I spend time both in Toronto and Silicon Valley working

00:23.940 --> 00:26.860
at some of the top tech firms there.

00:26.870 --> 00:33.320
I have spent a lot of time at these companies consulting on very large projects and also mentoring junior

00:33.320 --> 00:40.730
developers and I have taken all of these skills and poured all my knowledge into this course. As a matter

00:40.730 --> 00:41.570
of fact.

00:41.810 --> 00:45.840
I have left my lucrative role to build this course for you.

00:46.910 --> 00:48.100
Here's the thing.

00:48.590 --> 00:52.550
I've created this course because I've been in your shoes.

00:52.610 --> 01:00.350
There's so much information out there on the Internet so many courses, tutorials, classes and books that you

01:00.350 --> 01:08.870
can read, videos you can watch but there is never a real guide that teaches you what you need to learn, how

01:08.870 --> 01:15.170
you need to learn it, and most importantly what is actually relevant at this moment for you to gain valuable

01:15.170 --> 01:17.680
skills and earn a high salary.

01:18.980 --> 01:26.240
Most courses are either outdated and teaching you less valuable skills like JQuery or PHP, or the

01:26.240 --> 01:31.700
course doesn't cover the full spectrum of technologies that you need.

01:31.700 --> 01:38.390
Instead you end up watching somebody else code along on your screen for hours without fully understanding

01:38.390 --> 01:39.680
everything.

01:39.860 --> 01:45.260
When time comes for you to be interviewed you stumble or you can't explain things.

01:46.490 --> 01:52.010
In this course we won't be taking any shortcuts and we won't be wasting our time on skills that are

01:52.040 --> 01:53.430
outdated for 2018.

01:56.050 --> 02:02.080
I will take you from understanding how the Internet works to building a final project together where

02:02.080 --> 02:09.790
we build an image recognition app by creating the front end with React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, connecting

02:09.790 --> 02:11.040
to an API,

02:11.280 --> 02:20.050
a server with Node and Express in a database using Postgres all built from scratch by ourselves.

02:20.050 --> 02:23.370
And don't worry you will learn what all of these mean.

02:23.650 --> 02:30.520
Now the best part; along the way you'll buld other projects with me that you can put on your portfolio

02:30.820 --> 02:33.240
to impress your future employer.

02:33.400 --> 02:39.430
Three hours into this course you'll create a startup landing page with me that is actually on the Internet

02:39.820 --> 02:42.270
and accepting emails through MailChimp.

02:42.790 --> 02:48.660
All technologies and tools used in this course are going to be free.

02:48.740 --> 02:54.650
You're going to learn real skills that are in demand right now used by some of the biggest firms like

02:54.650 --> 03:00.980
Google, Facebook, and Netflix, using the trunk method of educational psychology.

03:00.980 --> 03:08.210
We'll be building the Lego blocks to build the foundation, then expand into specific skills.

03:08.210 --> 03:10.580
This is the proudest work of my life.

03:10.700 --> 03:17.290
I guarantee you that there isn't a course out there that is as comprehensive and as easy to follow.

03:17.420 --> 03:25.600
Best of all I'm going to be constantly updating the course with new information and videos. Now you don't

03:25.610 --> 03:29.600
need to pay thousands of dollars for a developer bootcamp.

03:29.780 --> 03:35.840
You don't need to spend months and years figuring out what to learn what is outdated and how things

03:35.840 --> 03:37.400
are connected.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.670
This course is all about efficiency.

03:40.670 --> 03:46.850
If you value your time everything in this course is directly related to what you can do as a developer

03:47.090 --> 03:51.940
to jumpstart or grow into your career.

03:51.980 --> 03:55.900
Remember nobody is born a developer.

03:55.910 --> 03:58.070
We all started zero.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.680
Nobody is good at anything

03:59.680 --> 04:08.640
at first; there was a time when Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, or even Alan Turing couldn't count to ten.

04:09.630 --> 04:18.720
You will struggle, you will make mistakes, but with each video you'll learn more, and more. Each time making

04:18.720 --> 04:22.010
your brain just a little bit stronger.

04:22.020 --> 04:31.660
This is the path to becoming a web developer and I guarantee you that I will help you get there whoever

04:31.660 --> 04:34.810
you are wherever in the world you are.

04:34.810 --> 04:36.470
You can learn anything.

04:36.760 --> 04:37.910
I have done my job,

04:37.940 --> 04:45.160
if at the end of this course, you are fully employable as a developer.

04:45.170 --> 04:46.810
So, the best time to start?

04:47.350 --> 04:49.430
Well, that was yesterday.

04:49.490 --> 04:53.940
The next best time to start? It's today.

04:53.980 --> 04:59.650
Check out some of the preview videos, and course description for more details to see if this course is

04:59.650 --> 05:00.180
for you.

05:01.310 --> 05:02.920
I'll see you on the inside.

05:02.920 --> 05:03.350
Bye bye.
