00:01.180 --> 00:08.340
In this video we're going to set up our terminal to look nice along our newly set up Sublime Text.

00:08.350 --> 00:14.620
As you know the terminal is just a text based way to communicate with the computer instead of the

00:14.620 --> 00:22.030
Graphical User Interface that we normally use. As developers you will spend a lot of time with the terminal.

00:22.030 --> 00:24.950
Especially as you become more and more senior in your role.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.070
So let's make it better.

00:27.970 --> 00:36.120
If we open up the terminal - I have it open already for myself, you see that we have the word 'bash' here.

00:36.120 --> 00:41.640
BASH is a type of shell that a terminal can have.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.480
And what do I mean by that?

00:43.740 --> 00:50.690
Just as the name suggests, it's just the casing around the terminal that is customizable.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.930
There's actually more than one shell.

00:53.940 --> 00:55.400
Bash is just one of them.

00:55.740 --> 00:58.320
One of my favorites are 'Oh my ZSH'.

00:58.360 --> 01:06.690
There's the 'Fish shell' and they all have different things that you can do with them,

01:06.690 --> 01:10.800
but it's just another way to customize your workstation.

01:10.800 --> 01:18.540
Before I get into that, let's just customize our 'bash'. The way we do that is we can first start off with

01:18.720 --> 01:25.680
getting something other than just having this to the left. The way we do that is we type in 'nano' 

01:25.800 --> 01:37.170
which is a text editor and then we do '~/.bash_profile'. And here what we open

01:37.200 --> 01:43.140
is a file that is the bash profile. So this is what our profile will look like.

01:43.140 --> 01:48.810
This file gets read every time we open up the terminal. In here we can put in a bunch of things that

01:48.810 --> 01:50.550
we want our terminal to do.

01:50.550 --> 01:58.560
One of the cool things that I really think is fun is updating your 'PS1' variable. And I'll link to

01:58.560 --> 01:59.540
this website.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.960
And there's a bunch of examples here that we can use.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.820
Let's just pick one that - like this one over here.

02:05.820 --> 02:09.090
All we do is copy and paste this.

02:09.300 --> 02:13.920
And within our bash profile we can just copy and paste.

02:14.150 --> 02:18.920
And as you can see our PS1 now equals a whole bunch of gibberish that we don't really need to worry

02:18.920 --> 02:19.390
about.

02:19.520 --> 02:25.220
We see over here that to exit we need to do Ctrl-X then save modified,

02:25.220 --> 02:28.230
we just press 'Y' and then press 'Enter'.

02:29.490 --> 02:41.030
OK, nothing happens but the way we fix that is we now do 'source' and then '~/.bash_profile'. It essentially reloads

02:41.030 --> 02:44.090
our profile now. And look at that.

02:44.270 --> 02:50.840
We now have a cool little prompt to the left. So you can set up your PS1 to display whatever you want.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.080
If you want to your current directory to display,

02:54.080 --> 02:56.210
that's great. If you want your username to display,

02:56.210 --> 02:57.870
that's good as well.

02:57.950 --> 03:00.400
You can set up in a ton of ways.

03:00.410 --> 03:05.670
The other thing that the terminal lets you do, if you click on something like a background color,

03:05.880 --> 03:09.070
You'll get a few things that you can change in your shell.

03:09.110 --> 03:12.910
You can change your color based on what you want.

03:13.280 --> 03:20.420
And if I bring this over here you can also click on the profile and actually it gives you a bunch of

03:20.600 --> 03:22.920
pre-built ones that look really cool.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.630
This is 'Pro' actually very nice.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.870
Again you can customize this as well.

03:26.900 --> 03:32.570
And as I mentioned a different operating system, you have your own ways to customize it.

03:32.810 --> 03:39.110
But every single one usually has a profile and a way to modify what gets displayed based on your needs.

03:39.110 --> 03:47.660
Now the one that I really really like, is a shell that's different than bash and I've used this one before

03:47.660 --> 03:51.670
which is really really good it has a ton of themes that you can use.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.100
They have a bunch of options and you can play through them.

03:54.230 --> 03:56.740
The one that I really like is the 'Fish Shell'.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.130
It's very simple.

03:58.160 --> 04:06.060
It has all the operating systems on it and I install it using 'homebrew'. For those on a Mac, Homebrew is

04:06.480 --> 04:09.060
a way to install anything from the web.

04:09.060 --> 04:15.090
So instead of me going to a website and installing something, I can use a command line to download things.

04:15.090 --> 04:21.660
If you go to the Homebrew website, brew.sh, You can actually just copy this link into your terminal

04:21.870 --> 04:22.740
copy and paste it.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.970
Press enter and it will install homebrew for you.

04:26.870 --> 04:34.140
I already have this installed, so I'll just exit that. The way I install fish -

04:34.180 --> 04:39.770
you can see over here all I have to do is say "brew install fish"

04:39.980 --> 04:45.550
And while this is happening, I want to show you another option. So we have the terminal over here,

04:45.650 --> 04:53.000
But 'iterm' which again is specific for Mac is really really nice and it's way more customizable than

04:53.000 --> 04:53.870
the terminal.

04:53.870 --> 05:05.010
So I prefer using 'iterm2'. If I open this and double click and look at that. This looks way nicer already.

05:06.650 --> 05:08.840
So let's just compare them side by side.

05:10.820 --> 05:13.950
I have my - let's make that a little bit bigger,

05:13.970 --> 05:19.770
I have the bash shell here and I have the fish shell here.

05:20.970 --> 05:27.500
Although they both are in the desktop right now they're running on different shells.

05:27.810 --> 05:34.730
The fish shell has - just like we have with the 'bash_profile', has its own profile.

05:35.220 --> 05:41.780
So you can set it up. And you can set up which one gets activated when you first open up the terminal

05:41.780 --> 05:49.170
or iterm. What I recommend is to set up your workstation in a way that's nice to you.

05:49.200 --> 05:54.030
My preferred way is to use iterm and the fish shell.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.680
But if you want to use bash that's great.

05:56.680 --> 06:03.340
The beauty here is that if I type in 'bash', I get taken to the bash profile. And if I type in 'fish',

06:03.340 --> 06:05.450
I get back to fish.

06:05.460 --> 06:12.310
iterm also lets you just customize everything really nicely. If I go to Preferences, you'll see here that

06:12.430 --> 06:19.690
I have Appearance, Profiles, where we can have Colors set up. And there's a ton more you can do with your

06:19.690 --> 06:25.160
terminal. But I won't get into in this video because everybody has their own way of doing things.

06:25.180 --> 06:34.470
I just wanted to show you a basic setup, so that now you have a nice environment that you can work at.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.510
I'll see you in the next one. Bye bye
