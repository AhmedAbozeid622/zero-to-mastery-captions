00:00.480 --> 00:01.230
Welcome back.

00:01.410 --> 00:05.020
Let's continue building our robot friends app.

00:05.080 --> 00:12.460
Now up to this point if you look at our index site genius Well there was a lot of copy and pasting that

00:12.670 --> 00:15.640
we did if we had a lot of robot friends.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.810
Imagine having 100 of these that we have to constantly copy and paste.

00:19.910 --> 00:21.530
That's not very efficient does it.

00:21.730 --> 00:30.160
Also if you remember our diagram over here of one way data flow we always had a parent such as an app

00:30.160 --> 00:34.980
component that had children that had their own children and so on and so forth.

00:35.050 --> 00:43.300
So using that knowledge we can have one big component that have different children so that we make each

00:43.300 --> 00:47.970
component small and reusable.

00:47.990 --> 00:57.160
Let's go back to our example now that we have a robot that J.S. we ideally can list all these 10 users

00:58.700 --> 01:09.740
the way we do that let's have a card list component so that we import a cardless component which is

01:09.740 --> 01:17.000
a parent of card then we can just render that instead of all these cards.

01:17.290 --> 01:30.390
So I'll say the card list and again we'll have to created say a new file card this stodginess

01:33.060 --> 01:43.050
again change you get to our table syntax will do import re-act from re-act and I'll make this a little

01:43.050 --> 01:44.970
bit bigger.

01:45.020 --> 01:52.800
And again we'll just say Konst card list equals won't accept anything for now.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.530
But it will return.

01:56.890 --> 02:01.700
Well what should a return.

02:01.850 --> 02:05.070
It should return the cards right.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.960
We can just copy and paste this

02:11.750 --> 02:13.160
put this in here.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.750
Let's fix the indentation here a bit

02:18.730 --> 02:26.660
now card list will be the one that returns these cards and index.

02:26.710 --> 02:33.280
A symbol will just render Carlist.

02:33.350 --> 02:39.330
If I save this while I'll guess that card isn't being used so we can't remove it.

02:39.770 --> 02:42.500
And robots aren't being used.

02:42.620 --> 02:48.400
But we can use the robots now to pass that as robots.

02:48.400 --> 02:59.560
He calls the robots array card list is accepting a robots prop.

02:59.730 --> 03:05.880
I say this everything's working but I'm getting this error because well as you can see we didn't export

03:06.950 --> 03:13.910
if we go back to the card list export default and hopefully by now you're start to get the hang of it.

03:13.920 --> 03:20.040
There's a lot of repetition here but each time as long as you learn the syntax we're creating these

03:20.520 --> 03:28.410
components nicely and we get a ton of errors because we don't have any access to robots and IDs and

03:28.830 --> 03:30.270
card for that matter either.

03:30.300 --> 03:37.520
So let's import a card from Again same directory card.

03:37.700 --> 03:38.400
Yes.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.960
Robots isn't defined.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.540
We know that card list receives robots now.

03:45.540 --> 03:52.540
So I have access to it and the props or I can be structured and say that we have access to it.

03:53.570 --> 04:04.940
With robots if I see this look I have everything back the way it was.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.390
But it's not all of them is it.

04:07.390 --> 04:10.480
We're only grabbing the 0 1 2.

04:10.510 --> 04:11.800
Only three of them.

04:11.800 --> 04:17.970
And as we saw on robust Yes I have 10.

04:18.130 --> 04:20.870
How can we do this better.

04:21.040 --> 04:28.410
Let's make this a little bit smaller so you can see it looks like we want to do some sort of a loop.

04:28.510 --> 04:29.410
Right.

04:29.410 --> 04:35.650
We want to loop over the robots and create a card component for each one.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.880
How can we do that here.

04:36.900 --> 04:45.060
Andrea let's start off by adding another variable here we'll call it Konst card

04:47.740 --> 04:50.300
component.

04:50.510 --> 04:56.630
And within the card component we want to say that robots we want to.

04:56.690 --> 04:59.390
Well what do we want to do when we do a loop.

04:59.420 --> 05:03.460
As I've said before we want to map right.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.740
We could do for each as well but I always recommending that.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.280
And within this map each robot

05:11.820 --> 05:12.930
gets this.

05:12.990 --> 05:16.800
So we get a user every time we map through it so we can say user

05:20.070 --> 05:26.550
should return again because a map needs to return it returns this right.

05:26.610 --> 05:32.890
We want to return a card component I can copy and paste this right here.

05:34.500 --> 05:42.370
And within the return I can just say now instead of robots index 0 do we have the index Well yeah because

05:42.450 --> 05:48.800
you remember the second parameter that we get in a map is the index.

05:48.800 --> 05:52.730
So I can say a user and I for index.

05:52.790 --> 06:03.640
And now within robots I'll say hi for index Ishaan the first time around this will be zero then 1 then

06:03.640 --> 06:07.610
2 all the way to 9 to include our 10 robots.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.260
Let's see if this actually works.

06:11.360 --> 06:19.260
If I had card component here you remember that we have to wrap it in curly brackets because it's javascript

06:19.260 --> 06:22.170
so it knows to evaluate.

06:22.410 --> 06:28.270
If I saved this looks like it's compiling successfully I go back and.

06:28.630 --> 06:29.960
Holy moly.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.650
Well we got ourselves a card or a.

06:33.820 --> 06:35.140
How cool is that.

06:35.140 --> 06:37.160
That was incredibly fast to do.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.820
We just use our common sense and Javascript knowledge.

06:41.020 --> 06:46.240
Just use map to return multiple components.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.620
I hope you realize how powerful that is and that is why re-act is so popular right now.

06:50.680 --> 06:57.510
We're able to use javascript to return these Shyamal elements and do things really really fast.

06:59.390 --> 07:04.240
If I open up the console here I'll see that I get a warning.

07:04.250 --> 07:11.120
Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique key prop and there there's a link to it if you

07:11.120 --> 07:12.280
want to read up on it.

07:13.370 --> 07:20.450
This is a special case that you just have to remember when working with react the way the virtual Dom

07:20.450 --> 07:23.950
works is it keeps track of what all these cards are.

07:24.320 --> 07:35.300
But without having something called a key prop if some of these cards get deleted react to won't know

07:36.720 --> 07:42.660
which ones which and will have to change the entire Dom vs. if he had a key proppant says oh this one

07:42.660 --> 07:43.230
gets removed.

07:43.230 --> 07:49.080
I can just remove this from the don't member we want to minimize the amount of work that we do to the

07:49.080 --> 07:50.190
dump.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.170
So when you do a loop it's just something you have to remember.

07:53.220 --> 07:57.100
You have to give it a unique key in our case.

07:57.240 --> 08:01.200
We can just say hi which is index.

08:01.210 --> 08:02.250
If we save this

08:05.300 --> 08:10.130
up we have to wrap it in curly brackets again.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.720
Because it's javascript and there you go.

08:14.740 --> 08:22.800
Now we don't have the air any more.

08:23.020 --> 08:29.150
And let's just make this on a new line just sort of looks prettier.

08:33.640 --> 08:39.270
And because we're returning it on multiple lines we want to wrap this in a bracket right.

08:39.340 --> 08:42.070
And that's better.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.350
So this is working nicely as we want it.

08:45.420 --> 08:51.150
I want to show you one thing because this is java script anything we put in these curly brackets is

08:51.150 --> 08:53.940
javascript including comments.

08:54.450 --> 08:58.730
Well we can just copy and paste this entire thing.

08:58.800 --> 09:04.080
Remove the constant and just add it within the brackets.

09:07.750 --> 09:14.360
If I save this it should still work like it does.

09:14.500 --> 09:20.200
And this is another power of re-act react makes you a really really good javascript programmer because

09:20.920 --> 09:25.040
other than this GSX syntax everything else is just javascript.

09:25.390 --> 09:32.830
So we are able to create a cardless component that lists cards and all we need to do is pass it a prop

09:33.310 --> 09:39.140
of robots and we just made this a htan cleaner.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.840
Very cool.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.880
All right that's it for this video.

09:42.890 --> 09:45.490
More things will happen in the next one.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.600
See you on that one.

09:46.610 --> 09:46.880
Bye bye.
