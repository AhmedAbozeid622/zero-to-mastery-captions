WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:02.310
All right.

00:02.310 --> 00:03.240
Welcome back.

00:03.240 --> 00:06.540
We have our Hello World app but that doesn't look very cool.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.430
We want to make our robo friends app.

00:09.450 --> 00:16.540
So in this video we're going to get started by building our first component if we go back here.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.080
We remember that we have the terminal on the right hand side.

00:19.100 --> 00:25.880
And we just ran NPM start and create exact outs checks all the files for us make sure there's no errors.

00:25.880 --> 00:33.680
It says that our app is defined but never used so let's comment this out again comment slash say this

00:34.370 --> 00:37.080
and you'll see that everything's working fine.

00:38.590 --> 00:42.510
Now you may have a few questions just on this index.

00:42.570 --> 00:43.510
Jay Yes.

00:44.210 --> 00:48.920
One we see that we're importing react but how come that's working.

00:48.920 --> 00:55.390
We remember that it didn't work before we had to use require and then browser fi again re-act has a

00:55.390 --> 00:59.260
wet pack underneath the hood that does the bundling for us.

00:59.260 --> 01:03.670
So we're allowed to use imports as long as we keep this at the top of the file.

01:03.760 --> 01:10.650
We can import whatever other files we want or whatever packages we want.

01:10.660 --> 01:14.300
We also see that there's two things react and react.

01:14.350 --> 01:21.200
Dom if you remember re-act is a view library.

01:21.260 --> 01:25.660
So this is the little robot that we remember from the previous video.

01:26.030 --> 01:31.120
It's the core of the package that does the DOM manipulation for us.

01:31.310 --> 01:35.890
But as I said before Riak can be used in multiple places not just the browser.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.330
It can be used for mobile devices.

01:38.330 --> 01:45.350
It can be used for virtual reality and you can plug and play different libraries like this based on

01:45.440 --> 01:47.850
what screen you're rendering to.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.830
So react arm is used for the dumb Web sites.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.370
So the glue of react.

01:54.390 --> 01:57.620
But we can have something like re-act native.

01:57.620 --> 02:01.950
That actually renders two mobile phones.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.740
We also have import and export CSSA.

02:04.760 --> 02:13.340
And this is a new syntax will react to allows us to add CSSA not just in one file but for each different

02:13.340 --> 02:14.270
component.

02:14.390 --> 02:15.960
If we go to APT.

02:16.110 --> 02:21.000
Yes well we have dot CSSA that describes the app.

02:21.230 --> 02:22.890
If we go to index yes.

02:22.910 --> 02:32.060
While we have indexed starts SS that has its own cells and these cells will only apply to whatever components

02:32.540 --> 02:35.740
index suggests renderers.

02:35.910 --> 02:41.550
And the way we use it is we just say import and then unlike Riak package where we just say the name

02:41.550 --> 02:47.940
of the package and it automatically knows to check the known modules folder we have to tell it where

02:48.000 --> 02:49.770
index Dotsie SS lives.

02:49.830 --> 02:55.170
And this syntax of Daut slash means it's in the same directory.

02:55.320 --> 03:01.690
So it's saying check on the source folder and ex-Nazi SS should be there OK.

03:01.740 --> 03:05.100
And finally we see register service worker.

03:05.100 --> 03:11.040
And this is an advanced topic that we won't cover in this course but think of service workers as a new

03:11.040 --> 03:16.660
feature that allows our apps to become faster and potentially work offline.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.130
It's something that we don't need to concern ourselves with.

03:19.140 --> 03:26.220
So for now you can combine this out and it will still work but we'll keep it here just because create

03:26.220 --> 03:34.880
re-act up gives it to us for free the things that we really really care about though is while this line

03:34.880 --> 03:43.160
over here this whole thing is what re-act does it saying I want the react package to use the function

03:43.250 --> 03:52.600
render and this render is I wanted to render whatever this is but if you remember before we had app

03:55.110 --> 03:59.060
and well this isn't really an a shemale tag is it.

03:59.220 --> 04:04.850
We've just created this from it looks like the same directory.

04:04.860 --> 04:12.450
There's something called app and it doesn't have a dog geus file like we see it over here and that is

04:12.450 --> 04:19.390
because it automatically says that if there's no dot CSX or any type after it.

04:19.410 --> 04:27.480
Well it assumes that it's javascript but this will work as well as you can see because the last go to

04:27.540 --> 04:34.620
app dodgiest file and see why we can use this issue and Alt-Tab that we've created if we go to opt out

04:34.640 --> 04:40.230
Jeff's file Well again we see that we're importing something we're doing something called destructuring

04:40.230 --> 04:42.420
here and getting component as well.

04:43.350 --> 04:49.660
And we have a few files like Logo SVGA and abduct CSSA that we're importing.

04:49.950 --> 04:52.300
And again we see that our syntax is a little bit.

04:52.300 --> 05:03.830
So make sure that we change our files to javascript table and it looks like CLOS app extends component

05:04.520 --> 05:05.830
that comes with react.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.060
And this is just standard syntax.

05:08.090 --> 05:15.740
This renders member a component always has the role that it must to render at least something.

05:15.960 --> 05:21.260
And the way we do that is we return a a Chanel piece of the Web site.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.870
So we see over here welcome to react to get started at Ed.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.940
Well that's exactly what it says over here.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.440
That is the power of react.

05:29.450 --> 05:38.680
We're creating our own custom components our own cost him a shemale tags that we can just add and be

05:38.670 --> 05:38.870
free.

05:38.860 --> 05:45.320
Remember the one way data flow picture we have one parent that has children.

05:45.320 --> 05:52.050
So app has children but you know what let's build our own component to make this point clear.

05:52.370 --> 06:00.370
Instead of having hello world in here let's create a component called hello and it's a self-closing

06:00.380 --> 06:02.500
tax so you want to have the backslash.

06:02.700 --> 06:08.630
And and here instead of saying import app let's do import Hello from.

06:08.970 --> 06:11.750
We'll call it hello.

06:11.830 --> 06:12.600
Yes.

06:12.610 --> 06:14.710
And you'll notice that it's capitalized here.

06:14.810 --> 06:19.790
Well if you're building a component the standard is that it's capitalized.

06:19.880 --> 06:28.690
So it'll be called Hello dodgy Yes if we save this we'll get an error says module not found can't resolve.

06:28.730 --> 06:29.070
Hello.

06:29.090 --> 06:31.070
Because the file doesn't exist.

06:31.070 --> 06:32.290
So let's create one.

06:32.330 --> 06:38.590
I'm going to say new file Hello dodge Yes there you go.

06:38.670 --> 06:42.920
We have a new hello digest file and it's compiled successfully.

06:43.020 --> 06:46.370
If we go to the Web site well look at that.

06:46.380 --> 06:51.920
It actually even gives us air on the Web site and that's why create react is just so awesome.

06:51.990 --> 06:57.660
It shows you exactly what the errors are without opening up the console right here.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.830
Again we have nothing built right now in Halo So we need to create it.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.030
Let's use the app that J.S. as an example.

07:06.030 --> 07:14.860
It looks like we need to import re-act and component so we need say and poor re-act component from Riyadh.

07:15.460 --> 07:16.170
Okay.

07:16.590 --> 07:25.080
And the reason we're doing this again this is destructuring instead of doing re-act dot component we

07:25.080 --> 07:31.270
can now just do component and it means the same thing.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.370
Again looking at dodgiest it looks like we say class.

07:34.430 --> 07:39.460
Our computer name extends component to that class.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.800
We'll call this hello again.

07:41.800 --> 07:47.990
That's what our components called extends component.

07:48.040 --> 07:58.780
And again remember to change our javascript to Paypal and if you remember one rule is that we always

07:58.780 --> 08:07.600
want to have a render function and within this render function we tell it what we want to return.

08:08.070 --> 08:13.870
Well we want to return the hello world example but we can say H-1

08:16.630 --> 08:18.290
Hello world.

08:21.940 --> 08:27.340
Okay let's see what happens when I do this I save.

08:27.520 --> 08:31.650
And it says export default importer's Hello was not found.

08:31.650 --> 08:34.770
Well it's because we're not exporting this.

08:34.770 --> 08:42.660
Remember if we want another file to use it we have to export and we use export default when we're just

08:42.930 --> 08:44.760
exporting one thing.

08:44.760 --> 08:50.880
If we use the word default that means this file only exports one thing and that is the app.

08:50.880 --> 08:54.690
So I can say export default.

08:55.310 --> 08:57.650
Hello.

08:57.730 --> 08:59.220
Let's save.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.100
Looks like it's working.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.070
Let's see what happens in our upside.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.470
Hello world.

09:04.490 --> 09:12.300
We've just created our very first component How cool is that now.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.290
Right now we only have one line.

09:14.300 --> 09:22.610
But what if I wanted to do something like Divx wrapping it in a div and maybe underneath here all say

09:23.240 --> 09:31.550
a paragraph that says walk to react.

09:31.630 --> 09:35.270
If I save this I get another error

09:38.020 --> 09:45.010
and it's because we're just giving him multiple lines here and returns expecting a single thing.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.850
We need to wrap this in brackets.

09:49.020 --> 09:55.270
Like this in order to have javascript say this is an expression.

09:55.270 --> 09:57.190
Evaluate this entire thing.

09:57.340 --> 10:05.690
If we save this looks like it's working and then hello world welcome to react.

10:05.770 --> 10:06.580
Very cool.

10:07.710 --> 10:18.780
Within here if you remember if we import Daut Hello Dad CSA us we can create whatever CSSA styles we

10:18.780 --> 10:25.620
want but we need to create that file for Salles to new file.

10:26.050 --> 10:27.660
And I need to outturn Owen here.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.350
The new file name will be hello.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.090
C Ss now.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.720
Hello CSSA I can just say that the H-1.

10:34.770 --> 10:40.150
And this is just standard C Ss will have background of red.

10:40.470 --> 10:42.320
I'm going to save save.

10:42.330 --> 10:43.230
This is Rawle.

10:43.230 --> 10:44.400
Everything looks good.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.490
And look at that.

10:49.300 --> 10:55.480
But you know what to make this faster and because we've gone over CSSA I want to show you a cool package

10:55.510 --> 11:05.080
called Tatiana's and tak Kyon's allows us to have similar to bootstrap predefined class names that we

11:05.080 --> 11:08.720
can just add to components to make things look really really nice.

11:08.770 --> 11:09.470
So let's do that.

11:09.490 --> 11:17.750
I'm going to close this and say am pm install Tatiana's.

11:17.800 --> 11:18.290
All right.

11:18.290 --> 11:21.390
It's additive package we can check by going to package on.

11:21.410 --> 11:27.920
We see that Tatiana's are there and we can use Tatiana's very easily but just going to index not just

11:27.920 --> 11:33.200
file and saying import catkins.

11:33.420 --> 11:38.960
And now we have access to this package just to show you attack.

11:38.990 --> 11:42.510
Odds are if I go to tack Kyon's styles

11:46.820 --> 11:54.200
that gives us law classes that we can use that for example text Center we'll just say TC and as long

11:54.200 --> 12:01.220
as we have tack on we use TCAS class name will align are text.

12:01.330 --> 12:06.880
So now that we have Kyon's and it's indexed not just fall we can just say within here

12:10.990 --> 12:19.230
equals F 1 for Fonte want and tech center I save.

12:19.340 --> 12:19.880
I have to do.

12:19.880 --> 12:20.960
NPM start here.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.510
Make sure that her server is running so that we can check our changes.

12:25.220 --> 12:30.970
And we get hello world Volcom to react.

12:31.020 --> 12:33.210
But there's actually one trick here.

12:33.210 --> 12:39.270
If you open up the console although this worked I get a warning saying invalid Dom property class.

12:39.270 --> 12:41.330
Did you mean class name and reacts.

12:41.340 --> 12:50.810
Really really good at giving you errors and you might be asking yourself why a class name instead of

12:51.050 --> 12:51.650
class.

12:51.800 --> 12:57.840
Because if I save this go back I no longer have that air.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.370
Why is that.

12:59.600 --> 13:04.310
Well up until this point we've kind of just been a.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.950
But this is a javascript file.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.180
How are we able to do this.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.430
This is actually something called GSX.

13:13.430 --> 13:23.520
Part of the act is that it allows you to write this email like syntax in your javascript and you might

13:23.520 --> 13:32.790
be asking yourself one doesn't that break the rule of separation of concerns and to how are we even

13:32.790 --> 13:39.210
able to add a symbol to javascript to answer the first question separation of concerns react has the

13:39.210 --> 13:44.910
idea of components and that is it's better to have functionality and styles per component so that each

13:44.910 --> 13:47.940
component is its own separate universe.

13:47.940 --> 13:50.160
And you just add these components.

13:50.670 --> 13:58.440
And the idea of separation of concerns with react is that components Well they're concerned about themselves

13:58.470 --> 13:59.260
nothing else.

13:59.430 --> 14:03.570
So it changes the paradigm here and it's kind of nice right.

14:03.570 --> 14:05.090
I can just look at the halo component.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.410
I know exactly what it's doing.

14:06.420 --> 14:07.900
I can look at the CSSA.

14:08.460 --> 14:14.730
And any time I need to make a change I just need to worry about the files that contain the hello CSSA

14:14.730 --> 14:15.960
and Javascript.

14:15.960 --> 14:21.510
The second thing is this disk thing called GSX underneath the hood.

14:21.540 --> 14:29.040
What reactor's doing is actually letting me use this syntax but they're not actual a simple tax.

14:29.160 --> 14:34.890
Remember what I said about the virtual Dom and how re-act creates its own object and then looks at the

14:34.890 --> 14:39.360
DOM and compares it and says Hmm I need to change this and it does it for us.

14:39.360 --> 14:48.110
Re-act uses GSX to create their virtual Dom their fake Dom that they built based on what we give it

14:48.120 --> 14:48.850
to them.

14:48.990 --> 14:55.350
Then they look at this virtual Dom and the real Dom and say this part has changed.

14:55.350 --> 15:01.930
I'm going to change the Domhnall based on the virtual Dom and that is why I react as really really fast.

15:02.070 --> 15:08.430
It creates objects which is really fast and Javascript and only changes what needs to be done in the

15:08.430 --> 15:09.020
door.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.790
So just get used to it.

15:10.830 --> 15:18.240
It's awkward at first but again as long as you wrap it in a bracket you can write here a shemale as

15:18.240 --> 15:24.180
well as your own custom components such as Halo that we used in index not just for

15:28.540 --> 15:39.600
and now maybe it makes sense why we can't say class here because class is a reserved keyword in javascript.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.830
Class is part of the language that javascript uses.

15:42.840 --> 15:49.630
So if this is javascript the fact that we're same class here doesn't make sense in the old version of

15:49.630 --> 15:50.080
react.

15:50.080 --> 15:57.780
This actually broke react but now gives us a nice error because this is javascript and not a shemale.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.150
We have to say class name and it's something that you'll get used to.

16:01.150 --> 16:05.890
You'll get tricked up with at the beginning but it becomes easy after a while.

16:06.040 --> 16:12.010
The last thing I'm going to show you is the part of react within the halo component.

16:12.040 --> 16:16.320
I can now add something called props or properties.

16:17.290 --> 16:19.270
And these props can be called anything.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.350
Think of them as a shim all attributes.

16:21.370 --> 16:24.560
I can say greeting.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.850
He calls them within here.

16:28.030 --> 16:35.520
I want to wrap it in curly brackets and this is a javascript expression whatever I want I can say hello

16:38.980 --> 16:49.000
re-act ninja and if I save this I get an error saying that no useless concatenation.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.970
So it's saying that hey why are you even adding things he can just put them all together.

16:54.070 --> 17:00.100
So it's hard enough to even give you suggestions or warnings of when you're doing something that's not

17:00.100 --> 17:00.360
clean.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.050
But for now for demonstration purposes this is fine.

17:03.400 --> 17:10.870
Now that I've given it what we call a greeting Propp to hello I now have access and hello.

17:10.990 --> 17:14.640
Yes to prop's I can now say

17:17.190 --> 17:31.820
this dot prop's dot greeting I save this go back and I say hello re-act Ninja.

17:32.050 --> 17:43.650
You see with this syntax it's saying that this object which is Halo has properties props that is greeting.

17:44.060 --> 17:51.140
I know this is confusing is just the syntax you have to get used to but now we have access to whatever

17:51.350 --> 17:57.100
property and whatever property value we get from.

17:57.270 --> 18:02.320
Hello this is a power that will come in handy later on.

18:02.390 --> 18:08.080
But I want you to build your own component here and get comfortable with the Sendak's.

18:08.230 --> 18:14.110
It is really really powerful and once you get used to it you can build any components you want.

18:14.350 --> 18:14.650
OK.

18:14.680 --> 18:15.670
One final thing.

18:16.760 --> 18:23.560
This index might be kind of difficult but I want to show you that this is actually just a function.

18:23.730 --> 18:38.580
If I do Konst hello and in here this function accepts props if I do an error function here.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.620
Wrap it in curly brackets.

18:40.860 --> 18:47.620
And instead of doing this render I just simply return

18:54.720 --> 19:02.670
if I saved this well I'm getting an error because this stub props out greetings doesn't really exist

19:02.700 --> 19:05.220
because it's not an object anymore.

19:05.220 --> 19:06.120
It is a function.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.280
So I don't need the props.

19:07.290 --> 19:14.040
It receives props whatever parameters we give it and props that greeting is acceptable to us.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.820
I save this go back and look at that.

19:16.830 --> 19:17.710
It's working.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.820
It's just functions.

19:19.810 --> 19:27.510
Think of reactors that we're just creating these functions that take parameters and these parameters

19:27.780 --> 19:36.460
which are given by giving attributes and values are just being rendered.

19:36.740 --> 19:43.410
I have access to proper greeting if I give it another prop here called let's say a dog then I'll have

19:43.440 --> 19:47.110
props start dog available to me as well.

19:48.600 --> 19:54.210
And again we had a nice little error saying that component we're grabbing this but we're not really

19:54.210 --> 19:59.190
using it and we're using unnecessary string concatenation.

19:59.190 --> 20:05.770
Again really useful as you can see fairly simple to pick up in the next lesson.

20:05.780 --> 20:10.850
We're going to start actually working on our robo friends app now that we have the basics.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.620
I've seen that one by.
