00:00.510 --> 00:03.560
We've built our beautiful website.

00:03.840 --> 00:13.620
We've created a sign up form and it's fully responsive but it's just on our computers.

00:13.780 --> 00:19.360
Let's actually put this online. On the Internet so anybody can access it.

00:19.630 --> 00:23.160
And I'm going to show you one way to do it for free.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.250
Will take a bit of setup.

00:25.600 --> 00:31.060
But this way you'll have a website that is out there and you can showcase it to your friends.

00:32.480 --> 00:41.930
So to get started I'm going to suggest that you go to GitHub.com and you're going to create

00:41.930 --> 00:42.510
an account.

00:42.680 --> 00:46.990
And when we get to the GitHub and Git section we're going to talk more about this.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.640
But GitHub is a platform for developers to showcase their work but also put all their code and make

00:55.640 --> 01:01.670
sure that it's saved in a location. You can think of it as a resume for developers so. Any developer that

01:01.670 --> 01:04.810
I know has a GitHub account, so create your own as well.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.860
It's completely free and will allow us to put our website online for free.

01:10.040 --> 01:18.000
So sign up now and then I'm going to go back to my GitHub where I'm already signed in. And right here

01:18.270 --> 01:23.750
once you're signed in you'll get to this page and it'll say 'Start a project'.

01:23.760 --> 01:28.590
So I want you to click on 'Start a project' and here this is really important.

01:28.760 --> 01:39.770
You need to put the name they you have, your user name of GitHub, first and then put .GitHub.io

01:40.100 --> 01:42.550
So you have to name your repository. So you can

01:42.620 --> 01:49.800
think of this as project name and then you can click on 'Create repository'.

01:49.850 --> 01:53.120
You'll get this screen and it'll look very very confusing.

01:53.150 --> 01:55.540
Don't worry we don't need to worry about it.

01:55.670 --> 02:02.700
We're gonna have to use the 'Set up in desktop' button. In order to do that we need to download

02:02.700 --> 02:07.080
GitHub desktop client. So you can easily do that by

02:07.080 --> 02:10.930
downloading GitHub Desktop. There is for Mac for Windows whichever one you need.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.880
You can download. Once that's downloaded

02:14.880 --> 02:19.020
let's open it up and you can see here we have

02:19.020 --> 02:22.590
GitHub Desktop and then to double click to open it.

02:22.650 --> 02:28.140
You'll get the pop up but you can just open and once you have this you can click on 'Clone a repository'

02:28.770 --> 02:35.039
and you will have to sign in to GitHub so this needs to know what your account is on GitHub.com

02:35.040 --> 02:40.290
So I'm going to click 'sign in' and again this is. you can sign in with your own credentials here

02:44.750 --> 02:45.350
and there you go.

02:45.350 --> 02:52.200
We should be all signed in. The next step is we're going to click on something called 'Clone a Repository'.

02:52.330 --> 02:58.500
So we're going to click on that and we're going to search for the repository we just created.

02:58.510 --> 03:04.750
So if you remember your username.github.io and because it's signed in to your account it knows

03:04.750 --> 03:05.750
where to find it.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.590
So from here I'm going to click 'clone'

03:12.290 --> 03:15.200
and it did a whole bunch of magic behind the scenes.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.790
Don't worry about it for now.

03:16.790 --> 03:26.000
Now you want to open this repository in Finder. And it's going to open up your folder with your name

03:26.000 --> 03:31.610
on it and in there I just want you to copy and paste the three files.

03:31.610 --> 03:36.700
You have your index.html your style.css and your header.jpg.

03:36.770 --> 03:41.330
If you have any other files for your website just keep them all in there just a reminder to take it out

03:41.330 --> 03:42.300
of the folder.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.590
There you have it.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.590
I don't want to delete that.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.160
So I'm going to copy that back OK.

03:47.690 --> 03:56.450
And once you have that it there, close it. And now you'll see that you have this three files that you've

03:56.450 --> 03:58.610
just added.

03:58.800 --> 04:06.960
All we need to do now is just write a summary of this. So 'uploading website' and then 'Commit to master'

04:06.960 --> 04:08.730
you'll need to add a summary in here

04:08.730 --> 04:14.660
otherwise it won't let you click. You click on that and again something happened some magic.

04:14.660 --> 04:20.510
But if you click on the history tab you'll see that your files are still there. And the final thing you're

04:20.510 --> 04:24.170
going to do is click this 'Publish branch' button.

04:25.030 --> 04:33.300
If you click on this it's doing a whole bunch of work behind the scenes and it looks like it's done.

04:33.330 --> 04:34.500
Now here's the cool part.

04:35.440 --> 04:41.750
Let's go back to our website and remember this screen.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.430
Now if I refresh

04:46.370 --> 04:48.950
I have my files in there.

04:48.990 --> 04:54.270
So now this location is referencing these files.

04:54.390 --> 04:57.650
And guess what, your website is actually online.

04:57.780 --> 04:58.490
Don't believe me.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.680
Well let's check up.

04:59.940 --> 05:03.930
All we need to do is go to this link [username.github.io],

05:04.020 --> 05:05.270
Type it into the bar.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.790
Press enter and there you go.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.090
We have our website online.

05:13.530 --> 05:22.320
So now our beautiful website. Our startup page works and people can sign up for our mailing list.

05:22.650 --> 05:25.830
And check out our startup.

05:25.950 --> 05:26.840
Isn't that cool.

05:27.700 --> 05:33.820
We're going to be learning more about GitHub and Git later on in the course and there's a special section

05:33.850 --> 05:36.690
just for it because it's a very important tool.

05:36.880 --> 05:42.910
But I want you to put your website online so you can show it off to your friends and family and let

05:42.910 --> 05:46.180
them know that you're going to be a pretty good developer.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.950
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
