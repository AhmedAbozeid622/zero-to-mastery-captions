00:01.220 --> 00:02.900
Welcome back.

00:03.020 --> 00:09.000
Did you manage to build your startup landing page? If that's the case then you can follow along

00:09.000 --> 00:10.330
with your own code.

00:10.350 --> 00:14.350
Otherwise you can use my example and build on top of it.

00:15.080 --> 00:19.750
You can see over here what I've done and I'll just go over exactly what is happening with

00:19.750 --> 00:20.410
my startup page.

00:20.540 --> 00:25.200
As you can see it's nothing too crazy but it looks pretty sleek.

00:25.220 --> 00:28.350
I have a link to Google fonts.

00:28.370 --> 00:34.570
I have a link to Bootstrap and I'm using a CDN so I don't have to include my own files.

00:35.630 --> 00:42.680
And I also have a link to my own style sheet and I'm using a little bit of Bootstrap here to make these

00:42.680 --> 00:44.050
containers.

00:44.090 --> 00:51.810
I have my header and then I have a button with some Bootstrap classes and if you look in the

00:51.810 --> 00:59.040
style sheet I've actually overridden a few of the Bootstrap classes, so that I get my own custom color and

00:59.040 --> 01:00.620
some different fonts.

01:00.660 --> 01:01.040
All right.

01:01.170 --> 01:06.020
So how can you make this so when we click on this button we'll get an

01:06.150 --> 01:11.610
email sign up form so that people can sign up for our email list. And we're actually going to do this.

01:11.790 --> 01:16.740
I'm going to show you a nice easy free way of doing it and that is.

01:16.740 --> 01:19.440
Yes I am filming this at 7:53 in the morning.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.520
I'm a morning person.

01:20.640 --> 01:30.380
Let's look at MailChimp. So MailChimp is a great service that I use quite often and what it does is it

01:30.380 --> 01:33.080
helps you with email marketing.

01:33.220 --> 01:38.680
So I'm going to show you the exact steps you can take for you to create a sign up form. And with MailChimp

01:38.680 --> 01:45.820
it's actually free until you get 2000 subscribers which is more than enough to validate that your

01:45.820 --> 01:47.570
business idea is right.

01:48.850 --> 01:56.320
So let's create an account. I've actually created a new email for us to test this out on.

01:56.350 --> 02:02.750
'Andreithedev' we'll say 'devguy'. For the password

02:02.880 --> 02:06.530
I'll just make something up. Click 'get started'.

02:06.650 --> 02:13.010
And if we check our email we'll have an activation link.

02:13.020 --> 02:14.180
No I am not a robot.

02:14.190 --> 02:15.020
I'm a real person.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.630
'Andre' 'Dev'

02:23.250 --> 02:27.010
'Test' and our website, we'll just make something up.

02:27.020 --> 02:31.310
www.coolwebsite.com

02:31.440 --> 02:32.240
So the address,

02:32.250 --> 02:36.920
I'm just going to go through this quickly and skip to the last section.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.240
I we should get to this screen now.

02:44.280 --> 02:48.670
We don't want to subscribe to anything so we'll just click 'Let's go' OK.

02:48.770 --> 02:50.810
I won't be going through any of this stuff.

02:50.840 --> 02:56.500
You can look at it on your own I just want to show you how we can get a nice sign up form from the service.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.980
And we can actually click on 'Lists' here.

03:01.070 --> 03:05.480
'Create list' and we have to fill in a few forms.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.330
We can just do 'Test' here.

03:07.380 --> 03:10.570
Email address here will be my throwaway account.

03:10.590 --> 03:15.100
Test name we'll just do 'Test'. Write a short intro.

03:15.180 --> 03:29.200
'You signed up to do this because you wanted to be a dev'. And we'll just save that. If I now go in to 'Signup Forms',

03:29.190 --> 03:31.750
'Embedded forms'
