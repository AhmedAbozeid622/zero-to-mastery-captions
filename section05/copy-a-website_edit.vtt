Good afternoon! to you, not just Andrei.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.590
This is a fun little video.

00:07.590 --> 00:13.320
I like to throw, some of these, every once in a while because I know, it can get very exhausting, when you

00:13.320 --> 00:15.350
have a lot of information thrown at you.

00:15.390 --> 00:20.830
So I want us to copy a Website, really really fast.

00:20.860 --> 00:22.550
Let's, look at how we can do that.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.200
One of my favorite websites is

00:24.200 --> 00:24.640
'waitbutwhy.com'.

00:24.670 --> 00:30.580
Ooh It's all caps! I don't know why I did that, but it should still work.

00:30.630 --> 00:31.810
If you haven't checked out this website.

00:31.830 --> 00:32.810
I highly recommend it.

00:32.820 --> 00:34.670
Some great great articles on here.

00:34.710 --> 00:37.860
But let's say, I look at this website.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.680
I'm like hmm, this is really really cool.

00:39.780 --> 00:41.270
I wish I could play around with it.

00:41.300 --> 00:49.530
Well before I showed you, View, Developer, Developer Tools, and we had a nice little pop up

00:49.530 --> 00:50.130
at the bottom of the screen.

00:50.340 --> 01:00.170
This time I want to show you, "View Source" when you click on that, Oh boy! you get a whole bunch of stuff.

01:00.180 --> 01:07.430
But if you look at the top of it here, you see that it's "DOCTYPE HTML", is just simple HTML.

01:07.580 --> 01:10.500
And this might look, really really overwhelming.

01:10.610 --> 01:11.500
Don't worry.

01:11.540 --> 01:16.850
This will make sense to you at the end, but you can see over here that, they're commenting this out,

01:16.850 --> 01:18.160
There is the 'html' tag.

01:18.170 --> 01:26.480
And if you scroll down there's a whole lot of stuff, but simply by copying all this, so I can just select

01:26.480 --> 01:36.240
all and copy this and if I open up Sublime. There you go and let's just open up, a new file over here

01:36.570 --> 01:37.920
and copy and paste this.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.240
Oh that's a lot of stuff.

01:40.470 --> 01:45.690
I'm going to save with 'Save As' and we'll call it

01:45.690 --> 01:48.690
'waitbutwhy.html'

01:48.770 --> 01:49.770
All right.

01:49.830 --> 01:51.120
Save it.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.030
And now, if I go to my desktop

01:56.920 --> 02:04.990
and I have 'waitbutwhy.html', if I drag it into */Oops I can't grab it/* if I drag it into my Google Chrome

02:06.790 --> 02:07.640
look at that.

02:07.910 --> 02:11.350
I have 'waitbutwhy', all to myself.

02:11.390 --> 02:15.470
And I can play around with it and break it and do whatever I want.

02:15.650 --> 02:22.060
I can even see what they use to create these little post thing-a-dingies.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.050
But, a really really fun way, to play around with websites.

02:26.070 --> 02:28.870
Hope that was interesting, see you in the next one. Bye-bye
