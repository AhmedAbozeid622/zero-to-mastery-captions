00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.689
Welcome back! In the last section we talked about how
we have Google.com And if we enter an IP address

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:14.799
we essentially get all these files from Google so
if we look back at the diagram that we had we see

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.170
here that the Google servers just send us a couple
of files which are a HTML, CSS and Javascript, again

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.090
something that will cover later on.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.389
But for now based on that knowledge
we should be able to break Google.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.320
So let's play with something.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:39.109
If you open up Google Chrome and you go into View,
then developer, then Developer Tools you're going to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.260
have a screen over here that pops up.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.900
You might want to move it up and
down just so you can see better.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.800
And let me just scroll this down a bit so you
can see you'll see over here that there is

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:54.251
a little icon on the left
with a pointer in a window.

00:00:54.371 --> 00:01:00.091
If you click on that and now go to the website
you'll see it selects a bunch of different things.

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:03.601
So it's just an element selector
so, let's just click on this.

00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:09.860
So when I click on this it takes me to
the part of the HTML file that essentially

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:13.301
tells Google to put in Google search here.

00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:18.730
So based on that, we can do something fun, we
can get the value over here of Google search.

00:01:18.731 --> 00:01:22.511
And let's change it to 'Andrei's Search'.

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:30.751
Press Enter. Look at that - we have - we now just
changed Google to have 'Andrei's Search' over here.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.161
That's very very cool.

00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:35.798
I want to play around with
that and see what you can do.

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:40.170
For example if I now select this just like I don't
want this I'm going to press the delete key

00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:43.170
and just delete it. Look at that!
I can delete that.

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:44.280
OK I don't like that either.

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.951
I'm going to press delete on that as well.

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.200
And let's see.

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:54.761
You know what on the entire website I
want this entire body thing gone delete.

00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:55.331
Look at that.

00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:58.321
We just completely deleted Google.

00:01:58.361 --> 00:01:59.871
Now you must be freaking out.

00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:01.081
"What happened?"

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.481
"Am I going to get sent to jail?",
"I just delete the Google!"; well,

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:09.231
no, not really,
press enter and Google is back.

00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:10.511
Now why is that?

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:17.500
Well, if we go back to our diagram we have Google
servers and we were playing around with one of these

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:22.171
files and we just modified it we
essentially just said delete delete.

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:27.641
So Google was gone but when I made that
request again Google servers, 'no problem,

00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:29.031
we have these files'.

00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:32.131
They send these files all over again,

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.081
back to the server.

00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:40.430
Hopefully that made sense to you we see that
the browser essentially is a tool - a piece

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:45.421
of software that can receive files from
servers and it knows how to read them.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:52.971
So that, look at that, we get pretty Google and we can
type in all the searches that we want in the world.

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:57.481
All right let's get to the next section
where we talk about the Internet backbone.

00:02:57.731 --> 00:02:59.171
See you on the next one! Bye-bye.
