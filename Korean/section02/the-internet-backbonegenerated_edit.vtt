00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.229
Hey they're welcome back.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.040
All right if you thought so far
everything's been really really cool.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.200
Well, things are gonna get a lot cooler.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.859
We're going to be talking
about the Internet backbone.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.340
So we recognize this because I've been talking
about it for the last couple of lessons.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.039
But some of you may have had a question
that is what do the arrows mean.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.689
I mean it's kind of like magic right.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.590
I just told you that we send off the IP address to
the servers the server responds with some files but

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.660
this is just magic like what do these arrows mean?
So, we're going to talk about that in this lesson.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.259
And we're going to do that with this really, really
fuzzy diagram that I found online from this website.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.029
It's not the clearest picture but it actually has
some really important things so I want to use that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.200
to demonstrate to you what
the Internet backbone is.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:59.290
So, as some of you know the way we connect in our homes,
at a coffee shop, or at work is we usually have

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.209
Wi-Fi or you know maybe sometimes we still have people
they are using Ethernet cables

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.160
and connecting through those.

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:11.939
But for now let's just focus on the fact that we have
a home and we have Wi-Fi and this Wi-Fi essentially

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.550
gives us Internet from the router.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.640
You can see this little person over here working hard
with a router next to him and this router is connected

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.250
all the way to something called a modem.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.779
And this is something that if you ever sign up for
Internet or change providers you most likely had

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.970
somebody come to your house
and install something.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.079
And that's this box over here that
essentially allows the ISP the Internet

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.160
Service Provider,
this big building over here,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.000
we remember that, to connect to it.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.620
So this modem has the signal
towers that transmit signals of,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.899
you know Google.com and it receives these messages
and then this is why I picked this image just

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.209
because I think it's incredible you see this wire
that is connected all the way to the ISP and then

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.460
the Internet Service Provider, the ISP is connected to
this magical blue cable that is the Internet backbone

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.429
and something that's really important in this image
is the fact that there's Wi-Fi which is over the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.225
air but at the end of the day everything
is kind of connected through cables.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.380
So some of you or many of you,
or all of you might be wondering

00:02:27.404 --> 00:02:30.490
"What the hell is this Internet
backbone thing?"

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.290
Sounds cool. But this - this is kind of vague, so I found a
really, really cool - cool thing that we can do together

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.210
I'll post this website in
the notes after this lesson.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.310
But if you go over here you actually see the Internet
backbone. So, let's say we're in Brazil and we want

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.690
to search Google.com.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.529
Well from Brazil, from our home, through Wi-Fi, it
connects to our router, to our modem and then all the way

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.290
to our Internet Service Provider lets say (the) Internet
service provider is over here and then, through

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.639
cables it connects all the way to, let's say this point
over here, and let's say, for now that the Google

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.690
servers are located somewhere
in Portugal over here.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.799
Well that signal of me looking for that IP address of
Google and looking for those Google files is going

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.350
to go through this submarine cable.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.739
Yeah, you heard that right.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:30.929
It's a physical cable that goes at the bottom of the
sea floor from Brazil all the way to Portugal where

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.570
the Google servers are.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.080
And then the Google server says yep I got those
files here there are and sends it all the way back.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.350
Through the ISP all the
way back to our house.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.546
Isn't that cool that there's physical cables that are
connecting, and creating the Internet so you know

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.869
there are times where somebody destroys or something
happens where these cable connections are cut off

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.560
and you sometimes lose
internet connection that way.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.760
But yeah the Internet backbone is literally just
this network all over the world of connected cables

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.190
so that we can transfer these
files all over the world.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.110
And just to show you how insane this is somebody from the
Opte Project over here - I got this off of Wikipedia,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.870
mapped out, and I believe this was in 2015, just 30
percent of the network, and you can see over here that

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.240
each one of these dots is an IP address.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.769
So, a computer that is connected to another
computer, that is connected to another computer.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.819
And that's the Internet.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:47.085
The Internet is just all these connected computers
that are just transferring files between each other

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.760
and as web developers and
this is the coolest thing.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.089
And that's why I just think everybody should
be a web developer because it's so cool.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.789
You're allowing this to happen.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.450
You're allowing this transferring of files from one
computer to another, transferring knowledge from

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.159
Brazil to Portugal and all over the world and you get to
be part of it - you get to be part of this networking

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.080
and get to evolve.

00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:17.939
When this picture of the Internet came to
me I knew that this was the career for me.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.839
So, hopefully that gets you
excited in the next session.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.049
I'm going to show you
something really cool.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.490
Traceroute before we finish up the lesson and we get
into the next sections so hope that was cool see

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.510
in the next one.
