Welcome back! In the last section we talked about how we have Google.com And if we enter an IP address

00:08.850 --> 00:15.960
we essentially get all these files from Google so if we look back at the diagram that we had we see

00:15.960 --> 00:22.330
here that the Google servers just send us a couple of files which are a HTML, CSS and Javascript, again

00:22.380 --> 00:24.250
something that will cover later on.

00:24.360 --> 00:29.550
But for now based on that knowledge we should be able to break Google.

00:29.550 --> 00:31.480
So let's play with something.

00:31.620 --> 00:40.270
If you open up Google Chrome and you go into View, then developer, then Developer Tools you're going to

00:40.270 --> 00:42.420
have a screen over here that pops up.

00:42.580 --> 00:46.060
You might want to move it up and down just so you can see better.

00:46.090 --> 00:52.960
And let me just let me just scroll this down a bit so you can see you'll see over here that there is

00:52.960 --> 00:56.410
that little icon on the left with a pointer in a window.

00:56.530 --> 01:02.850
If you click on that and now go to the Web site you'll see it selects a bunch of different things.

01:02.920 --> 01:06.360
So it's just an element selector so, let's just click on this.

01:06.370 --> 01:13.120
So when I click on this it takes me to the part of the file the part of the HTML file that essentially

01:13.120 --> 01:16.560
tells Google to put in Google search here.

01:16.590 --> 01:21.990
So based on that, we can do something fun, and we can get the value over here of Google search.

01:21.990 --> 01:25.770
And let's change it to 'Andrei's Search'.

01:26.280 --> 01:34.010
Press Enter. Look at that - we have - we now just changed Google to have 'Andrei's Search' over here.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.220
That's very very cool.

01:36.270 --> 01:40.250
I want to play around with that and see what you can do.

01:40.320 --> 01:44.610
For example if I now select this just like I don't want this I'm going to press the delete key

01:44.610 --> 01:47.610
and just delete it because I can delete that.

01:47.610 --> 01:48.720
OK I don't like that either.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.390
I'm going to press delete on that as well.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.640
And let's see.

01:53.640 --> 01:59.200
You know what on the entire web site I want this entire body thing gone Delete.

01:59.230 --> 01:59.770
Look at that.

01:59.890 --> 02:02.760
We just completely deleted Google.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.310
Now you must be freaking out.

02:04.420 --> 02:05.520
What happened.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.520
Am I gonna get - am I going to get sent to jail I just delete the Google; well,

02:09.730 --> 02:14.470
no, not really, I just press enter and Google is back.

02:14.530 --> 02:15.750
Now why is that?

02:15.760 --> 02:23.440
What if we go back to our diagram we have Google servers and we were playing around with one of these

02:23.440 --> 02:28.110
files and we just modified it we essentially just said delete delete.

02:28.240 --> 02:33.880
So Google was gone but when I made that request again Google servers, 'no problem,

02:33.910 --> 02:35.270
we have these files'.

02:35.410 --> 02:38.370
They send these files all over again,

02:39.390 --> 02:40.820
back to the server.

02:40.890 --> 02:41.670
It's not up here.

02:41.740 --> 02:43.150
But yeah, it gets in there.

02:44.990 --> 02:52.070
As you can see hopefully that made sense to you we see that the browser essentially is a tool - a piece

02:52.070 --> 02:57.760
of software that can receive files from servers and it knows how to read them.

02:57.770 --> 03:05.310
So that, look at that, we get pretty Google and we can type in all the searches that we want in the world.

03:05.340 --> 03:09.820
All right let's get to the next section where we talk about the Internet backbone.

03:10.070 --> 03:11.510
See you on the next one! Bye-bye.
