00:00.800 --> 00:02.390
Welcome back!

00:02.390 --> 00:07.640
Good job! You've made it this far and you're probably asking yourself, "Andrei,

00:07.670 --> 00:09.570
this has been really good really informative.

00:09.590 --> 00:12.270
But where is the coding; I want to start building some Web sites."

00:12.300 --> 00:15.320
And I know, I know we'll get there don't worry.

00:15.320 --> 00:22.100
But without even realizing it you just learned some really really important fundamental skills, and something

00:22.100 --> 00:31.100
that will take you, in the career of a web developer, very far because now you know how to improve website

00:31.180 --> 00:37.940
performance without coding a single - a single line of code. Just so you know we're going to get a little

00:38.360 --> 00:39.590
silly here.

00:39.590 --> 00:45.410
We're actually going to make sure that you remember these fundamental skills every time throughout these

00:45.410 --> 00:50.780
lessons that there's going to be chunks of very important lessons and to symbolize how important they

00:50.780 --> 00:51.150
are.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.590
I'm going to get Jean-Claude Van Damme's help.

00:53.590 --> 00:56.240
So again this is an important lesson.

00:56.240 --> 01:00.130
This is an important fundamental, web developer concept.

01:00.140 --> 01:03.040
So Jean-Claude Van Damme, how important is it?

01:07.890 --> 01:08.270
All right.

01:08.280 --> 01:11.030
So as you can see a very important concept and what is it?

01:11.040 --> 01:18.570
Well like I said without writing a single line of code you now know how to improve a Web site's performance

01:18.570 --> 01:20.180
so let's think about this.

01:20.220 --> 01:21.870
There's three things.

01:21.870 --> 01:28.230
We send 'google.com', we talk to Google servers, and we get these files back. So just looking at this and

01:28.230 --> 01:36.890
looking at what you've learned so far what's one thing that would make sure that this this process would

01:36.890 --> 01:37.950
be fast.

01:37.950 --> 01:41.070
Let's look at the first one I'm going to give you a second to think.

01:41.220 --> 01:42.690
Hopefully you get it.

01:42.690 --> 01:45.240
The first one is location of the server.

01:45.270 --> 01:48.090
We saw how big the Internet backbone is.

01:48.090 --> 01:54.510
So if the servers are really really close to you, let's say you're in the States and the servers are

01:54.510 --> 02:01.770
just a couple of kilometers away that hop is going to be really really fast versus if it's all the way

02:01.770 --> 02:02.640
across the globe.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.280
So location of the server is important.

02:05.430 --> 02:09.990
And we'll talk about these and how big companies use these to their advantage later on.

02:10.010 --> 02:12.540
But so that makes sense.

02:12.540 --> 02:13.770
Let's look at the next one.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.580
So the next one is how many trips.

02:16.590 --> 02:24.980
So hopefully, ideally we just have one trip to the Google servers and Google servers send us all the

02:24.980 --> 02:26.200
files that we need back.

02:26.330 --> 02:32.870
But as we know there's new pages there are searches so this communication with Google is back and forth,

02:32.870 --> 02:33.640
back and forth.

02:33.650 --> 02:41.040
And the less trips we have, the faster - the faster that we would be able to to get the files.

02:41.240 --> 02:48.970
So how many trips. And then finally size of files again if this HTML file, CSS file, or Javascript

02:48.970 --> 02:52.980
file is massive and it's you know 100 megabytes.

02:53.060 --> 02:59.540
Well that's going to be a lot slower to transfer over the Internet than it is, if it was just a couple

02:59.540 --> 03:01.370
of kilobytes.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.220
So there it is.

03:02.310 --> 03:09.810
These three things are something that you'll take with you and you'll realize that every time you're

03:09.810 --> 03:15.390
building an application or web site you're going to be thinking about these things and these are going

03:15.390 --> 03:21.840
to help you make sure that you have a performant, fast web site and we're going to take these with us

03:21.990 --> 03:25.160
as we go on throughout the course. Talk to you soon.
