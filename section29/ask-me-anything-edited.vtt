00:01.440 --> 00:09.390
Hello and welcome to the Ask Me Anything video that I just impropmtu-ly decided to do after we hit a thousand

00:09.390 --> 00:14.640
students which was just last week and we already have over 2000 students.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.810
So I want to start off by saying absolutely thank you.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.720
Thank you so much for being part of this course.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.400
It is beyond what I expected.

00:23.400 --> 00:29.400
I thought I'll get a couple of hundred and call it a success but I've really really loved interacting

00:29.400 --> 00:30.170
with a lot of you.

00:30.170 --> 00:36.770
We have students from over 100 countries and everybody is so excited to learn, with so many different backgrounds

00:36.780 --> 00:39.600
and I just love the community that has come out of it.

00:39.630 --> 00:43.090
Like I said it was beyond my expectation and I love that

00:43.100 --> 00:45.230
everybody is so excited about learning to code.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.180
So thank you so much.

00:47.190 --> 00:51.780
You know I've created a couple of videos for you to watch but I think the community that is forming around

00:51.780 --> 00:59.790
and supporting each other and hopefully in a few months helping each other to become the Web developers

00:59.790 --> 01:00.780
that they want to be.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.300
I think that's the most amazing part.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.230
So again thank you so much.

01:04.230 --> 01:10.570
I'm just going to answer a few questions that some of you have asked to celebrate getting to a thousand students.

01:10.690 --> 01:14.570
Now the first one that I see over here is from Ashley.

01:14.730 --> 01:19.970
And she asked what was your biggest hurdle after learning, starting a new career field.

01:20.220 --> 01:26.140
I think the biggest hurdle that I encountered was definitely the imposter syndrome.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.250
You may have heard of it.

01:27.330 --> 01:32.340
It's the idea that you feel like an impostor you feel like everybody else knows this stuff except you.

01:32.350 --> 01:37.970
You sit in a room and people start talking and you realize that you have no clue what's going on.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.300
You're afraid to ask questions.

01:40.380 --> 01:41.820
And I think that's the biggest hurdle.

01:41.940 --> 01:49.980
Realizing that when you read something or watch videos online people have practiced this and made sure

01:49.980 --> 01:52.430
that there's no mistakes in their writing in their videos.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.330
And I did this as well.

01:54.900 --> 02:03.570
And what this means is that what we project onto our videos or onto our blog posts isn't exactly us being

02:03.570 --> 02:10.200
perfect it's us iterating and making sure that we check our mistakes and fix them so nobody out there

02:10.200 --> 02:14.390
knows every single answer about web development or coding.

02:14.430 --> 02:18.210
We all are beginners and we are problem solvers.

02:18.210 --> 02:23.930
We're really really good at solving problems not like dictionaries that know everything.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.010
So really realized that you're not an imposter you're not less than everybody else.

02:32.070 --> 02:37.320
Everybody has these difficulties and I think the biggest thing you can do as a developer is ask a lot

02:37.320 --> 02:42.880
of questions and each time you don't know something ask questions don't feel like...

02:42.930 --> 02:47.670
You're the only one that doesn't know. Most likely other people in the room don't know except they are

02:47.880 --> 02:51.100
afraid to ask a question or raise their hand.

02:51.120 --> 02:57.420
So I think that's the biggest hurdle, you get over that and you get comfortable asking questions to your

02:57.420 --> 03:03.810
coworkers and when you don't understand something I did that a lot when I first started coding and I

03:03.810 --> 03:10.090
was able to get answers and progress a lot faster than most people that didn't ask questions.

03:10.140 --> 03:13.370
So our next question was from Mike.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.670
Other than javascript.

03:14.670 --> 03:17.580
What is the most important language to learn.

03:18.150 --> 03:21.500
I have to say probably other than javascript.

03:21.510 --> 03:23.440
Python is a really good language to learn.

03:23.580 --> 03:29.540
Mostly because it's used a lot in machine learning and it's a very very fast growing field.

03:29.760 --> 03:34.470
And I'm going to write a little bit of a blog post on it so people can get familiar with it.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.640
But Python is definitely interesting.

03:37.080 --> 03:46.110
The other one I would say is Solidity which is the coding language that is used in building distributed

03:46.110 --> 03:51.860
applications for Ethereum, if you ever heard about Blockchain and all the hype with cryptocurrency.

03:52.330 --> 03:58.110
I think Solidity is a really interesting one in 2018 we're going to see a lot of distributed applications

03:58.110 --> 04:02.280
being created and there's a huge demand for developers who know that language.

04:02.580 --> 04:05.490
So I think those two are pretty pretty exciting.

04:05.490 --> 04:08.820
I'll be writing a blog post about it so you can get more information.

04:09.240 --> 04:14.210
You should look into those as well as Javascript... but focus on Javascript first.

04:14.220 --> 04:21.750
Next question was by Wasim and he asked if you were to hire a React Developer from students who completed

04:21.750 --> 04:22.750
this course

04:22.840 --> 04:25.010
What would be, what are you.

04:25.300 --> 04:29.900
I can't read today... what would you be looking for and what questions would you ask.

04:29.920 --> 04:30.930
Right.

04:30.990 --> 04:37.230
So I think I would ask number one what's the benefit of React? Did they just learn a couple of syntaxes

04:37.230 --> 04:41.100
and no React? Do they actually know what problems React solves.

04:41.100 --> 04:45.030
And I go over that in the course so hopefully you understand it as well.

04:45.360 --> 04:50.760
And then I will also ask about what are its shortcomings, when is it a bad time to use React.

04:50.770 --> 04:56.130
Because I've seen a lot of people who get really really excited about the technology and think it's

04:56.130 --> 05:04.110
the greatest gift ever without understanding that not every problem can be solved by one library.

05:04.290 --> 05:07.700
I think React is great for some things but not for everything.

05:07.710 --> 05:15.520
And there are a lot of shortcomings that come with React that you should know as well because if you're

05:15.540 --> 05:22.530
able to understand the pros and cons, well I think then you truly understand the library and you are

05:22.530 --> 05:26.760
able to make a good decision as a developer and it's something that I tried to do in this course which

05:26.760 --> 05:33.330
is not necessarily learn a bunch of functions and ways to do things but deeply understand and know what

05:33.330 --> 05:40.290
problems they solve and when they're good to use. And if you deeply understand that then I would a 100 percent

05:40.290 --> 05:46.740
hire somebody because I know that they have deep knowledge about something and not something superficial

05:46.950 --> 05:51.880
which in turn means that they're able to do more than just follow instructions.

05:51.870 --> 05:56.700
They're able to think on their own and doesn't just follow the rules and follow what I say, but can think

05:56.700 --> 06:00.170
for themselves and make good decisions.

06:00.170 --> 06:00.610
All right.

06:00.670 --> 06:05.820
Next one by Josh: which programming blogs do you read most frequently.

06:05.850 --> 06:10.330
I definitely like Medium. Medium is great for technical blog posts.

06:10.740 --> 06:18.150
If you haven't been there before just Medium.com and just follow anything... I actually I would say

06:18.150 --> 06:23.610
just follow the top 10 articles daily and see browse through them and see which ones are related to

06:23.610 --> 06:24.270
technology.

06:24.270 --> 06:25.940
I think they're really really good.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.750
That's actually how I started this course.

06:27.750 --> 06:33.790
I wrote a Medium blog post that became very popular and I thought hey maybe I should create a course.

06:33.810 --> 06:41.160
The other one is software engineering daily and that's a podcast that is really really good and it's

06:41.160 --> 06:46.740
not just about web development, it is just about software engineering in general and it can get very technical

06:46.740 --> 06:47.210
at times.

06:47.250 --> 06:52.450
It really gives you a good grasp of what's out there and the technology as it evolves.

06:52.590 --> 06:58.500
And then finally for Javascript there is a javascript weekly newsletter you can google that and sign

06:58.500 --> 06:58.910
up for it.

06:58.920 --> 07:03.540
And every week it will give you updates on Javascript... a few more questions we have.

07:03.540 --> 07:06.110
What did you do prior to your career change.

07:06.540 --> 07:10.010
So I actually had an interesting career I guess.

07:10.020 --> 07:18.430
I used to train tour directors around the world so I'd fly to Costa Rica for example and train people.

07:18.450 --> 07:24.860
I also had a small business that I actually ran Yoga and Surf retreats.

07:24.930 --> 07:29.010
I've always worked with people and every once in a while I'll need a website made.

07:29.670 --> 07:35.490
And I would give a bunch of money to a developer and never know what was happening behind the scenes.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.900
The finished product would never come as I wanted it.

07:39.150 --> 07:41.840
And it was kind of this black hole that I was throwing money into.

07:41.850 --> 07:47.430
So I wanted to learn it for myself and that's kind of how I got into the field and next thing you know, I really

07:47.430 --> 07:53.370
really enjoyed it and decided to make the career move based on the fact that: A - it's a great industry

07:53.370 --> 07:55.950
to be in and that I found it interesting.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.220
The next question was how did you get your first job as a Developer.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.270
So I actually got my job as a developer.

08:02.280 --> 08:08.620
Five months after, well after starting with HTML. I didn't know what HTML, CSS, javascript

08:08.630 --> 08:12.000
or any of that stuff was. Didn't really know how the Internet worked.

08:12.060 --> 08:18.990
Five months later I got a job and not even as a junior developer but as an intermediate developer. That's

08:18.990 --> 08:25.050
nothing to do with showing off, but just to show you how fast you can progress through this career.

08:25.050 --> 08:29.120
If you really work for it and understand the fundamentals.

08:29.190 --> 08:35.430
So the first job that I got actually applied by messaging a bunch of companies that I was interested

08:35.430 --> 08:41.100
in and finding their email their CEO's email and letting them know that I was interesting in a role

08:41.100 --> 08:45.540
and that I was solving a specific problem that they had.

08:45.540 --> 08:51.810
So I would research the company and say "Hey I noticed that you know your website or your app could have this and

08:51.810 --> 08:52.800
this fixed.

08:52.830 --> 09:00.430
This is how I would do it." Or I would message a CEO be like "hey these are my past,

09:00.480 --> 09:07.290
Past achievements. I've recently turned into a developer and I guarantee you I will work twice as hard as

09:07.350 --> 09:12.570
anybody else on the team and just kind of make a grand promise,

09:12.570 --> 09:15.700
I guess, in order to really catch their attention.

09:15.720 --> 09:20.190
So another question was: how did the interview go?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.940
I actually had multiple offers.

09:23.970 --> 09:30.240
When I first got my developer role and I think I was able to get those offers not because I was the

09:30.240 --> 09:31.460
best developer in the world.

09:31.530 --> 09:39.570
And by no means am I that now, but I think in the interview, what I was able to do was to convince them

09:39.570 --> 09:48.440
that I will work harder than everybody else and I made sure to do that by showcasing that: A -

09:48.810 --> 09:50.180
I come from a different background.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.260
I'm not a computer programmer that

09:52.280 --> 09:58.830
graduated with a degree, and I turn that actually into an advantage by telling them all the other things

09:58.830 --> 09:59.920
that I've done beforehand.

10:00.420 --> 10:07.800
And then finally showing them that I was a self-taught programmer just like yourselves and showing that

10:07.860 --> 10:13.770
I had the ambition and determination, so that by the end of the interview I was able to convince them

10:13.770 --> 10:22.020
that although I may not be the most skilled developer out there, I would be the hardest working and I would

10:22.020 --> 10:27.150
make sure that I will learn these things so that I could become a really really valuable employee in

10:27.150 --> 10:28.440
six months.

10:28.440 --> 10:35.520
And I think if you're able to do that you'll be surprised how many more offers you'll get because there

10:35.520 --> 10:36.860
are a lot of developers out there.

10:36.870 --> 10:45.360
But it's really really hard to find developers who, A - can have... can follow instructions. B - can work

10:45.360 --> 10:52.680
hard and C - aren't so confident in their abilities that they have a narrow vision and don't take

10:52.680 --> 10:53.690
others inputs.

10:54.270 --> 10:58.500
So if you're able to convince somebody that you're going to help them out of you're going to work really really

10:58.500 --> 11:02.370
hard and that you're going to be an asset to them that will make their life easier.

11:02.370 --> 11:06.700
I think that is a great great way to land a job.

11:07.140 --> 11:12.330
All right next question from Wan is: three books that have inspired you in some way.

11:12.510 --> 11:19.050
And I've chosen non-coding related books just because I think the coding related books all the popular

11:19.050 --> 11:21.480
ones, everybody knows or you can google them around.

11:21.690 --> 11:24.280
But the three books that have really inspired me.

11:24.360 --> 11:30.120
One is the four hour work week by Tim Ferriss that some of you may have heard of.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.910
It's a very popular book.

11:32.260 --> 11:40.800
I don't like the actual content tips and tricks but I really like the way that Tim thinks, and he thinks

11:40.890 --> 11:49.060
in efficiency. And I'm obsessed with using our limited time to the most efficient degree possible.

11:49.380 --> 11:57.260
So that means what is the best way for me to learn a topic and not waste my time.

11:57.270 --> 12:02.910
What is the best way for me to learn something and get rewards as soon as possible and I'm sure you

12:02.910 --> 12:05.510
can notice in this course that's what I did.

12:05.520 --> 12:11.080
I wanted to find the most efficient way possible to start earning money as fast as we can,

12:11.120 --> 12:17.880
and start working in teams as soon as we can because, well, we have limited time and we're able to learn

12:17.880 --> 12:22.230
a lot more when we're surrounded by others when we're working in development teams.

12:22.530 --> 12:30.090
So that book, not just in developing has really influenced my life to make sure that I think critically

12:30.090 --> 12:39.090
about what I do to grow in career personally financially and emotionally, just everything to try and

12:39.390 --> 12:42.690
look at everything and how to analyze things.

12:42.690 --> 12:51.540
The second book was the "so good they can't ignore you" and this book is by Cal Newport and it's a book

12:51.540 --> 12:58.980
that I read and it changed my thinking completely once again and it taught the idea that passion isn't

12:58.980 --> 13:00.100
really a thing.

13:00.230 --> 13:07.620
When we're young we think that you know we're passionate about travelling we're passionate about surfing

13:08.160 --> 13:10.640
and we try and follow this passion.

13:10.650 --> 13:17.300
But this book argues that passion actually develops from mastery from becoming really really good at

13:17.300 --> 13:22.290
a skill where people start paying you money for it where you become respected in your field and people

13:22.290 --> 13:24.140
have admiration for you.

13:24.330 --> 13:31.950
And when you become really really good and master at your craft well that's when you become content

13:32.070 --> 13:35.090
with your life that's when you feel like you're providing value to people.

13:35.280 --> 13:39.760
And that book has really really shaped the last couple of years for me.

13:40.050 --> 13:46.520
It's why I've really got into coding and I've really started to enjoy it more and more.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.910
It's because I've become better and better at it.

13:48.930 --> 13:50.440
So I highly recommend that book.

13:50.460 --> 13:54.780
Finally a third book is "Smart Cuts" by Shane Snow.

13:54.780 --> 14:00.240
And this is a book that I recommend to everybody taking the course especially those that don't come

14:00.240 --> 14:02.690
from a computer science background.

14:02.730 --> 14:12.600
It talks about how you can actually climb the ladder of success not by just you know following the traditional

14:12.600 --> 14:16.040
path, but by jumping from side to side from it.

14:16.170 --> 14:20.210
For example you're an actor and now you want to become a developer.

14:20.340 --> 14:26.580
Well this book argues that that's actually better because you're able to use whatever you learned into

14:26.580 --> 14:33.930
that field and jump on this other ladder of developing and use those skills that no other person has

14:34.380 --> 14:40.710
such as communicating well with people and being empathetical and mimicking body language from each other.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.560
That's something that you know not a lot of developers know.

14:43.560 --> 14:48.330
So using those side skills to your advantage you can definitely check out the book.

14:48.330 --> 14:49.200
It's really really good.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.440
Highly recommend it.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.860
Next question: your opinion on the blockchain technology.

14:55.860 --> 14:56.880
Very very cool stuff.

14:56.880 --> 15:01.930
I'm actually really interested in it, and I'm writing a blog post on it.

15:01.930 --> 15:07.000
I think everybody should learn the blockchain data structure. You can actually do it in javascript and

15:07.000 --> 15:10.500
build a simple one quite easily in a day.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.820
And I think that it iss very very exciting.

15:12.820 --> 15:15.240
I think there's a lot of hype around it.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.390
I wouldn't recommend investing in it.

15:18.190 --> 15:23.870
But you know, to each their own. I think the technology is actually very interesting and there will be big changes

15:23.870 --> 15:27.780
in 2018 and the field will grow really really fast.

15:27.790 --> 15:28.340
All right.

15:28.420 --> 15:29.250
This is getting long.

15:29.250 --> 15:32.660
So last two questions.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.040
We have: what is the meaning of life?

15:36.100 --> 15:38.430
I am Probably the worst person to ask that to.

15:38.440 --> 15:45.070
I have no idea but I can tell you one thing that I live my life by and I heard it somewhere I wish I

15:45.070 --> 15:46.960
could credit the person that I heard it from.

15:46.990 --> 15:50.660
Provide more value than you capture.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.170
And I think that's really interesting.

15:53.560 --> 16:00.810
And this is what I did try to do with the course I tried to provide a lot of value as much as I could.

16:00.880 --> 16:04.570
And you know there are times that it really really sucked.

16:04.570 --> 16:11.380
Making this course because it took a lot of hours a lot of editing and a lot of times where I didn't

16:11.380 --> 16:17.440
like the videos so I had to redo it over but I wanted to provide something really valuable and just capture a

16:17.440 --> 16:19.460
little bit of the benefit.

16:19.690 --> 16:26.080
And I like this way of thinking I like this idea of providing as much value and not necessarily capturing

16:26.080 --> 16:32.690
it and getting upset if you know your course gets copied and torrented and people download it for free.

16:32.740 --> 16:37.880
If you're able to help a bunch of people that's great if you're able to capture a bit of the benefit

16:38.140 --> 16:38.990
that's great as well.

16:39.010 --> 16:42.210
But I think that's a really nice way of looking at things.

16:42.200 --> 16:48.070
And if we all strive to do that as web developers, to capture a little bit of the value that

16:48.070 --> 16:53.250
we provide to the world, I think the world would be a better place.

16:53.450 --> 17:00.430
All right last question: how many messages do you get every day from your students?

17:00.430 --> 17:06.060
I mean this number has definitely increased.

17:06.370 --> 17:12.760
You know I'm very very excited about it I can't believe that we have over 2000 students now and I definitely

17:12.760 --> 17:15.660
spend a lot of time... I wish I kept track of things.

17:15.660 --> 17:20.680
But you know I wake up in the morning I spend about an hour answering messages then in the afternoon

17:20.680 --> 17:26.310
I spend another hour or two answering messages and questions and again at night.

17:26.350 --> 17:31.320
I do that as well and if I don't do that three times a day I won't be able to keep up with it.

17:31.450 --> 17:36.700
I'll have to figure out a better system to it because I do want to answer each student.

17:36.700 --> 17:41.000
I want to I want people to feel comfortable asking me as many questions as they can.

17:41.260 --> 17:48.340
But I do also want to continue providing new videos and evolving the course to be better and better

17:48.370 --> 17:50.200
based on feedback.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.560
So we'll see.

17:52.570 --> 17:58.270
It's been it's been so much fun right now and so exciting that as some of you know I've quit my job

17:58.270 --> 18:00.660
to focus on this course full time.

18:00.820 --> 18:08.560
So all the feedback all the community and everybody that's helping me out on Slack/Discord answering

18:08.560 --> 18:12.420
questions and trying to form open source project.

18:12.460 --> 18:17.850
It's been really really fun and this is probably the most fun I've had working in my life.

18:17.860 --> 18:19.960
And for that I really really thank you.

18:19.960 --> 18:26.140
I think you're all amazing and I think what I provide is perhaps 20 percent of the value I think the

18:26.140 --> 18:32.800
community and the support that we're creating with this course is the big benefit and I hope it keeps

18:32.800 --> 18:36.750
growing and I hope it becomes something bigger than I ever envisioned.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.550
And I hope all of you.

18:38.710 --> 18:45.550
By the end of this get what you want out of it. Whether to improve your skills to get a job or just to

18:45.760 --> 18:48.260
get a little bit smarter.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.700
So I'll see you in the next video.

18:50.950 --> 18:58.040
Thanks for watching my face talk for I don't know how long this video is, but it felt really really long.

18:58.060 --> 19:00.330
I really really appreciate all of you.

19:00.610 --> 19:01.690
Thanks so much.

19:01.910 --> 19:02.780
Bye bye.
